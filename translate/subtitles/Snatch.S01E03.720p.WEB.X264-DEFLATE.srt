1
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:09,351
Hey, Vic, you should take a look at
this, mate. It's a bullion heist.

2
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:10,684
Do we have an idea
whose gold this is?

3
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:12,250
Yeah, we do. It's ours.

4
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,999
I'll get them to share that
gold, one way or another.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,292
- So, what's going on?
- Saul Gold's going on.

6
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,500
<i>He's called a job on.</i>
You pick up my clients,

7
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:21,167
the Heimels, from the airport.

8
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,332
What else are we transporting
other than the Heimels, Mr. Gold?

9
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,832
Diamonds. A fistful.

10
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,833
Where can we have
a little fun around here?

11
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:29,500
<i>What kind of fun
are you referring to?</i>

12
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:30,875
<i>Who's heisted my diamonds?</i>

13
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:32,250
I don't know yet, Mr. Gold.

14
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:34,292
I want my diamonds back
in 48 hours,

15
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,917
or I will cut off your cock.

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,458
Christ.

17
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:48,083
How we gonna write
this shit show up?

18
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:51,000
Way it happened, Bob,
is we burst through the doors

19
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:54,666
to be greeted by a crew of hopped-up gangsters
blazing lead in our general direction.

20
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,125
What the f...!

21
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,208
It was us... or them.

22
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:02,167
Right.

23
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:04,833
Us or them.

24
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:11,083
Lads. Looks like
we've got a live one.

25
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,042
I'll call in the paramedics.

26
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,333
- What you do that for?
- Forty grand, Bob.

27
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,625
Cost per prisoner per year.

28
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:21,500
Now, say this shithead gets 20
at Her Majesty's pleasure.

29
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:24,625
You're asking the taxpayer to cough
three-quarters of a million quid.

30
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:26,745
That's unconscionable, mate.

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
All right.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,542
Let's see what
Vic Hill's been up to.

33
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,833
- Bingo.
- Bingo.

34
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:44,208
Bang up job, boys.

35
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,292
Gold must be worth millions.

36
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,250
Gonna be front page news.

37
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:53,417
We'll get commendations
for this, gents.

38
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,667
Sorry to be the one
to break it to you, Bob,

39
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,417
but there'll be no medals or
marching parades for this one.

40
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,167
- Why?
- Well...

41
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,048
missus says she'll stop making love
to me if I don't buy her a fur coat.

42
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:25,166
You make a shit criminal
and a shit copper.

43
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:28,832
What's left for you, Bob?

44
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,625
Sod all!
That's what's left for you.

45
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:23,542
How the hell

46
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,292
did Castillo know
about the diamonds?

47
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,434
Come on, Charlie. We're talking
about loose chat and strippers.

48
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,658
Sonny probably owned the joint.
It takes one phone call.

49
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,999
Let's just tell Saul Gold
who heisted him.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,499
He'll get the ice back

51
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,917
and redecorate <i>El Flamingo</i>
with bits of Sonny's skull.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,832
But Sonny ain't Saul's problem,
is it? It's ours.

53
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:48,167
We guaranteed delivery,
so we gotta sort this shit out.

54
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,208
Well, bar selling
selective body parts,

55
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,083
we only have
two viable options...

56
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,250
Either we fence some of the gold
and raise the cash...

57
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,458
or retrieve the diamonds.

58
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,042
Retrieval. Lotti Mott.

59
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,917
She can work with us
from the inside.

60
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,375
We go in hard, we go in heavy,
and we light the place up.

61
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:09,875
She's a hot mess.

62
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,542
You need to wipe
your glasses, pal.

63
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,167
They've come over all misty.

64
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,184
Yeah, son, if you've got any
better ideas, then share 'em.

65
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,608
Yeah, we fence
some of the gold...

66
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,499
without sparking the enthusiasm

67
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,833
of the local
criminal fraternity.

68
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,500
The girl working at Saul's...
She's pin sharp.

69
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:28,000
She knows the business.
Chloe Koen is our ticket.

70
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,167
I want those diamonds back.

71
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,347
Let's take Lotti Mott
for a walk, shall we?

72
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,375
Everything go to plan?

73
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:48,375
What's your boy done
with my diamonds?

74
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,042
- Come again?
- Don't play the innocent with me, Vic.

75
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,750
Your boy says
that he got turned over,

76
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:57,833
which as a result has put me
and, conversely, you

77
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,583
a quarter-bar in the red.

78
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,666
My boy wouldn't
rip you off, Saul.

79
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,332
He knows what's what.
I'll talk to him

80
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,292
and get back to ya. <i>You iron
this proper now, Vic...</i>

81
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:11,292
or your boy will feel the sharp
end of my very sharp stick.

82
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:15,792
Vic, in the meantime,

83
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,166
all those privileges
you enjoy in that shithole

84
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,750
that make
your miserable existence

85
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:22,333
marginally less miserable
are revoked.

86
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,167
What did you do, son?

87
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,000
What did you do?

88
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,292
So, you want
to raid <i>El Flamingo,</i>

89
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:40,250
get the stones back, and you want
me to work the thing for you

90
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,667
from the inside?
That's the short of it.

91
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,042
And what's in it for me?

92
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,625
- Well, we cut you in.
- Diamonds?

93
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,999
No, no, no, no.
The ice goes back to Saul Gold.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,958
- Then what?
- Come on, you know what, Lotti.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I want to hear him say it.

96
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,292
- Gold.
- I knew it.

97
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,667
- I knew it!
- Will you shut up?

98
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,500
Listen, no word to anybody,
all right?

99
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:08,667
This is
some seriously heavy shit.

100
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,101
This is some heavy shit,
all right.

101
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,667
All right.
So you up for it or not?

102
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:17,750
- Equal partners.
- No. No.

103
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,958
You're a junior partner.
That's it.

104
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,667
Good luck with Saul Gold, boys.

105
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,333
All right.

106
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:33,833
All right.

107
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,208
Equal partners.

108
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,083
Hate 'Em.

109
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,625
Hate 'Em!

110
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:49,208
- What?
- Phone's on the piss.

111
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,708
You top it up? Yeah, last week.

112
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,950
Should be fully loaded.
Well, it's not bloody working.

113
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:00,542
Mine's gone down as well.

114
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,958
Come on. Come on.

115
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,750
Bingo.

116
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,625
What you got there, Fink?

117
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:32,750
Fraud case. Luxury goods,

118
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,292
knockoff Harrods hampers.

119
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,167
The Harrods Hamper Caper.

120
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,792
- Yeah.
- Just your speed, Bob.

121
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,208
You know, a little birdy told me

122
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,125
you spoke
with the armored truck driver.

123
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:46,917
Truck driver?

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,166
This bullion robbery is
strictly Flying Squad business.

125
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:54,292
We're on it.
Understood. You're on it, Teri.

126
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:59,542
And if I found out that you've been
tailing our investigation again,

127
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,833
I'll kick you square in those
raisins that you call bollocks.

128
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:05,500
Message received.

129
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,917
Loud and clear.

130
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,250
Hey.

131
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:23,708
Good boy.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,292
Hello.

133
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:23,000
These are staff quarters.

134
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:26,167
Strictly off-limits.
The party's upstairs.

135
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,333
- I'm not here for the party.
- You're not?

136
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,083
What are you doing?

137
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:37,417
- Who are you?
- D.I. Fink.

138
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,542
Well, will you kindly state
your business, sir?

139
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:44,208
I'm looking for a pair
of monogrammed slippers.

140
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,250
Sir, I don't know
what you are referring to.

141
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:50,708
I would like to see
proper identification.

142
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,500
Shift.

143
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,042
My gosh.

144
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,750
Hello, gents.

145
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,833
This is what you're up against.

146
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,833
I left something
in the safe room.

147
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,417
I can't let you in there, Lotti.

148
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:12,833
Manny.

149
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,208
Please do
one little thing for me.

150
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
You're always there
when I need you.

151
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,000
Could you open up the safe room?

152
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,667
Think I left my knickers inside.

153
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:32,083
We were...

154
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,832
Sonny likes to...

155
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,917
in the safe room...
for the cameras.

156
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,583
All the angles,
if you know what I mean.

157
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,750
Don't be in such a rush, Manny.

158
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,667
I'll come and find you later
and you can fill your boots.

159
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,458
Must've left my knickers
somewhere else. Laters!

160
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,125
Thank you for that.
That was... that was helpful.

161
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:18,917
I just gave you the layout
to Sonny Castillo's safe room.

162
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:22,167
Now, what's the plan?

163
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,568
Well, that's something that
we need to discuss internally.

164
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:27,875
Without you.

165
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,917
- Your boss is a dick.
- Well, he isn't my boss. He's my mate.

166
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,500
- Cheers, bro.
- Shut up.

167
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:40,667
Well, your mate... that bosses
everyone around is a dick.

168
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,268
If you want to turn Sonny Castillo
over, you're gonna need me.

169
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:47,208
You're gonna
need me in all the way.

170
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:48,958
I can work this thing
from the inside

171
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,167
whilst you lot
play silly safecrackers.

172
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,667
She's not wrong, Al.

173
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,083
And you can keep
Sonny distracted, can ya?

174
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,417
What do you think?

175
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:18,375
Boys, mark this down.

176
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:20,833
If you're not seen back in here
in less than two weeks,

177
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,042
send Brian round
and drag him out to 'em yard.

178
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,667
You have to cut
your hair regular, you know?

179
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,750
I'm after a fella called...

180
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:53,208
<i>- Windrush.
- -...Windrush.</i>

181
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,708
I hear he can help
with pest control.

182
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,792
Ooh. Windrush isn't here.

183
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,375
You can take Henry.

184
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:11,958
Okay.

185
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:13,958
I'll take Henry.

186
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,417
Shit.

187
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,167
What you wearing those for?

188
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,333
Lucky slippers.

189
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,833
- Relax, boys.
- Come on then.

190
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:49,500
- What you done now, Charlie?
- I just forgot my dad's birthday.

191
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:52,167
Nothing a bottle
of scotch wouldn't fix.

192
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,958
We're gonna need
a proper safecracker.

193
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,042
Yeah, all right.
Where we gonna find one of them?

194
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,167
Come through.

195
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:25,083
Bollocks.

196
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:29,667
This is medieval, this is. Now they're
depriving us of basic human necessities.

197
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,499
Got a long reach,
this Saul Gold, isn't he?

198
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,500
He's not bloody God, Hate 'Em.
It's just a coincidence.

199
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:37,333
- Really?
- Got a visitor, Mr. H.

200
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,500
A visitor?

201
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,333
There he is.

202
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,958
The prodigal son.

203
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,833
- You all right?
- Well, I'm pressed, Albert,

204
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,583
if you'd like to know.
I'm extremely pressed.

205
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,208
Saul Gold,
quarter of a bar in rocks,

206
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,500
on our watch. Strike a note?

207
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,083
There were
some extenuating circumstances.

208
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,666
We got rolled.

209
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,917
You're a Hill.
We do not get fucking rolled!

210
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,809
And you've done 15 years 'cause you didn't
pay your council tax, is that right?

211
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,166
You are clueless
as to the repercussions

212
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:17,833
of your extenuating
circumstances.

213
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,499
Saul Gold is
a murdering bastard,

214
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,666
and you and I are both
nose deep in the shitter, Son.

215
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,333
- I'm going to handle it.
- Are you now?

216
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,458
I need something from you.

217
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:32,237
Do you want me to wipe your ass?

218
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,167
I need you to put me
in touch with a safecracker.

219
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,042
I need the Ace.

220
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,000
Norman Gordon?

221
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:54,000
Last I heard, he was blasting out gangster
tours on Limehouse Lane for a living.

222
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,458
Is that it? No chat about the
football or the weather or...

223
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,250
Where is my hug? I've gotta go.
I'll see ya later.

224
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,292
Oi. Don't you go digging that
hole any fucking deeper, son.

225
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,375
Oi!

226
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:15,083
And on this very spot...

227
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:18,667
just outside
the Crown and Anchor Pub,

228
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:23,583
was the infamous scene
of Jack Pot and Regis McLemore's

229
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,333
first scrap with the Old Bill!

230
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,333
This incident led
the boys to realize...

231
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:33,583
Led the boys to realize...

232
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,125
So began a life of crime.

233
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,458
Piss off!
Out of the way, granddad!

234
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,167
Last time I saw you, you had a
snotty nose and scabby knees.

235
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,750
Now look at you, Albert.

236
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,292
- All grown up.
- Yeah?

237
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,875
Come on, it's been a while
since I've had scabby knees.

238
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:06,277
- How's your mom holding up?
- Yeah, she's all right. You know Lily, holding it down.

239
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,625
Not easy, being on her own.

240
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:12,750
Raising a kid
and husband locked away...

241
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,833
It takes its toll a marriage.

242
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:19,458
They... they all right?
Vic and Lily?

243
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:23,292
Yeah.

244
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,332
Tell me, there been much... demand
for your services as of late?

245
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,542
Pfft! What? For an analog
impresario in the digital age?

246
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:39,083
No, I've long been supplanted
by the hacker whiz kid.

247
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,458
Effing new school guys.

248
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,875
See... I have an expertise that nobody
seems to have the patience for.

249
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,208
Yeah, but it turns out
I may have a job...

250
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,417
for your specialist
expertise, Norman.

251
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,625
Steady as he goes.

252
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,333
I've only got 20 quid on me.

253
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't want your pocket change.

254
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:01,542
Tell me...

255
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,792
where are your slippers, boy?

256
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,193
Slippers? What are you talking about?
Who the hell are you?

257
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,125
D.I. Fink.

258
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,750
I know what you did.

259
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:15,666
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

260
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:20,999
No?...I think you do.

261
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,833
I don't know about any slippers,
but I do know my rights,

262
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,500
so either arrest me or piss off.

263
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,792
You know your rights, do ya?

264
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,833
What about my rights? Let me go!

265
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:39,999
Video clip has a male, 5'10,

266
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,101
wearing the monogrammed slippers
of the Cavendish Clan

267
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,333
at the site of an armored truck
heist two days ago.

268
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,917
You're Albert Hill's mate,

269
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:52,083
a wannabe gangster
in a little silly bow tie.

270
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:57,167
I want that gold, boy.

271
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,083
And if you don't
bring it to me...

272
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,750
I will come for it.

273
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,792
Eddie? We need more ribbon
for the prison orders.

274
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,292
Governor's wife loves
the ivory lace.

275
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:03,250
These bi-weekly palm greasers
are hell on inventory.

276
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,000
Albert must've bust his chain.

277
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,333
Just this way, sir.

278
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,333
- So sorry.
- What happened to you?

279
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:33,208
Mugger. I fended them off.

280
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:36,667
- Awful.
- Yeah, it was... it was nothing.

281
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:45,667
Thank God.

282
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,917
Those gold ingots were
just enough to cover it.

283
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:53,125
- You managed to fence them?
- Indeed.

284
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:56,042
- Run into any problems with that?
- Out-of-town connection.

285
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,042
Won't come back around.
. Well played, Ms. Koen.

286
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:02,708
I'll get this. Business expense.

287
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,332
Are we...
So, we're in business together?

288
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:08,750
Well, that would depend on if
you guys had any more to offer.

289
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:11,708
What if I told you...

290
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,708
we have substantially more
to offer?

291
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,542
I like the sound of that.

292
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,167
And Saul?

293
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,250
How would he feel
with such an involvement?

294
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:26,167
I could work as an independent contractor
for this particular commission.

295
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:30,375
It's on me. Business expense.

296
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,999
Lily? It's me.

297
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,499
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Just about.

298
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,542
Sounds like a bus station.
Where are you?

299
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,832
I'm on a landline,
so mind your "P's" and "Q's."

300
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,208
What's happened to the mobile?

301
00:23:57,292 --> 00:23:59,833
They put a squeeze
on my amenities.

302
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:02,667
Listen, are you
still sending the posies

303
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,917
to those that matter on the inside?
Yeah, of course.

304
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:08,125
Two bouquets a week.
Bleeding us dry.

305
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:11,167
If my sweeteners aren't sweet enough,
maybe we should just call it a day.

306
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,750
You've only got a few months
left on your sentence.

307
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:16,500
You can do that standing on your head.
Oi! You lot!

308
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,375
Can it
or I'll stripe the lot of ya!

309
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,583
You were saying, my sweet?
<i>You're out soon, yeah?</i>

310
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:29,083
Don't get gate fever.
Head down and behave, yeah?

311
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,000
Understood?

312
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,499
<i>Vic, do you hear me?</i>

313
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,208
Oi! Shut it! Shut it!

314
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,708
<i>- Vic?</i>
- Loud and clear, my angel.

315
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:42,750
Loud and clear.

316
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,000
So, what are
you after, Billy boy?

317
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,375
Your job, pal.

318
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:20,000
It's open.

319
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,792
All right, then.

320
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,292
Shit.

321
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:22,417
Hello, big boy.

322
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,667
What a sweet ass?

323
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:32,666
I'll leave this one with you

324
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:35,833
while I keep Sonny occupied.
Come on!

325
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,333
Lotti!

326
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,208
Bubbles with your bubbles, baby.

327
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,333
What's all this?

328
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:54,250
We've been fighting too much.

329
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:56,833
I thought we should make up.

330
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:59,500
- Come here, baby.
- Baby, you promised.

331
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:01,375
- Games first.
- Games first.

332
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,958
Okay, baby!

333
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,542
I'll set up the tiles!

334
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:36,750
Let's get 'em good, Charlie.

335
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,917
Norman.

336
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:47,458
Norman. Norman!

337
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
What are you doing?

338
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:02,708
Just a sharpener.
Dials in the fingers.

339
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:05,208
Right, yeah. Norman,
we've got a safe to crack.

340
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:07,000
I don't think I can, Albert.

341
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:10,667
Wait a minute. Right. Come here.
Come down here. Come here, Norman.

342
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,417
You're not sure
about what exactly?

343
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,417
Who've I been kidding?

344
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,958
I'm a rusty gun.
Past my sell-by date.

345
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,458
- Okay.
- I thought I had one good one left in me,

346
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,417
but it turns out I am just a mug
flogging two-bob gangster tours.

347
00:28:57,792 --> 00:29:00,583
Come on!

348
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:28,292
Woo! Come on!

349
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,167
Come on, you little prick!
Come on!

350
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,458
Come on, you pikey!
Come on then!

351
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,125
When I win, I'm gonna eat
you like a ripe mango.

352
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:50,000
If our relationship's
going to last,

353
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:52,167
we need common interests.

354
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,750
We've got common interests.

355
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:59,167
Focus on the game, baby.

356
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,375
My dad used to tell me stories
about you when I was a kid.

357
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:12,833
Yeah.

358
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:14,958
He said there wasn't
a lock you couldn't pick

359
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,333
or a safe that wouldn't
yield to your mastery.-

360
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,333
- You were my hero.

361
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:25,458
I drew a comic strip about you
for my school project.

362
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,625
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

363
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:34,667
"Norman 'The Ace' Gordon,"
I called it.

364
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,125
"Steady as he goes."

365
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:40,042
- Norman "The Ace" Gordon.
- Yeah, and that's you.

366
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,917
You are Norman "The Ace" Gordon,

367
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,333
King of the Safecrackers,

368
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,917
returning for one last caper.

369
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:52,166
Now...

370
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:56,332
go out there and secure your place
in criminal folklore... forever.

371
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,832
Let's crack this bastard!

372
00:30:58,833 --> 00:30:59,913
Your will, I say. Come on.

373
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:11,250
- Another bottle.
- Just play the tiles,

374
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:13,250
and then I'll get you
anything you want.

375
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:17,792
Okay.

376
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:27,167
- You all right?
- I bloody got him.

377
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,458
Fuck me. That's a big 'un.

378
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,693
Right, well, you crack on Norman.
I'll be back in a minute?

379
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:08,667
You see, some fools are always
punching above their weight.

380
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:12,417
And sometimes some wankers
never see it coming.

381
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,042
Jesus. Well, help me up.

382
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,167
Told you I had it covered, Al.

383
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:31,125
You're welcome, Billy.

384
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:49,167
- Twat.
- Me.

385
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:50,750
Go on in, drag him out.

386
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,833
How we doing, Norman?

387
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,208
Norman "The Ace" Gordon.

388
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,500
Bollocks!

389
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:39,332
- What is that?
- Piece of cake, son.

390
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,333
Leave it with me.

391
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,792
Wakey, wakey, Johnny boy.

392
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:49,833
- What?
- We've got a problem.

393
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:07,417
Bananagrams!

394
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,708
What the fuck?

395
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,625
Shit.

396
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,083
Bloody hell.

397
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:44,500
Norman! Norman!

398
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,750
Get out of here, Albert!
I'm done for!

399
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:53,833
Nobody turns over
Sonny Castillo!

400
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:56,708
Run.

401
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,250
Go!

402
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:11,667
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

403
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:16,708
Bastards!

404
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:35,999
Well, that went well, didn't it?

405
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,417
Why did he try
and blow the doors?

406
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,083
I told him...
I told him no explosives!

407
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:40,559
What are we going
to do about him?

408
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,000
We'll have to go back in.

409
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:05,458
- Hate 'Em.
- What?

410
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,958
Where's our friendly screw
with my hot water bottie?

411
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,351
Should've been here a half hour ago.
Do you want me to have a word?

412
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,667
No. I've got this one.

413
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:18,708
Vic. Vic. Oi!
Vic, where you going?

414
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,999
Oi. Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

415
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
What's the crack then?
Where's my hot water bottie?

416
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:31,500
You forget about me?

417
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:33,583
Listen, Mr. H. There's been
a change in protocol,

418
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,750
a crackdown on liberties.
Nothing to be done.

419
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,583
Don't be silly, Bert.

420
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,166
There's always
something to be done.

421
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:41,125
Orders from up on high.

422
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,917
Now, be a chap,
take it on the chin,

423
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:45,542
and get back
in your cell sharpish.

424
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:48,958
I'm Vic Hill! I own this wing
and every slag on it!

425
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,083
Riot squad, feed through.

426
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,000
Tried to warn you, Mr. H.

427
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,792
Prisoner 42718, Hill,
return to your cell immediately.

428
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,500
- Or what?
- Or we are authorized

429
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,458
to use reasonable force
to ensure you comply.

430
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,375
Please, Mr. H. Do as he says.

431
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:24,250
Jog on,
or you'll catch it first.

432
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,458
- Wrap him up, boys.
- Come on, you slags!

433
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:32,250
Come on, slag!
I'll kill the lot of you!

434
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:34,625
Striking a screw! You know
where that's gonna send ya!

435
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:37,208
Come on, I'll kill the lot of ya!
Come on! Come on!

436
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,332
I'll kill the lot of ya!
Come on! Come on, you slag!

437
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:43,042
I'll kill ya! Kill them all!

438
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,666
Come on, you slag!

439
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:48,125
Come on!

440
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,958
Now then, 42718,

441
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,417
contrary to popular belief, I am a man
with a generous and giving nature.

442
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:58,917
- Bollocks to ya!
- You just attacked a prison guard, Mr. Hill.

443
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:01,458
We don't take
that kind of behavior lightly.

444
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,417
Now, it's either the Shitter...

445
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:07,625
in which your punishment will be
of the digestive variety.

446
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,917
Or the Sleeper,

447
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:13,458
in which you will slip
into a vegetable state

448
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,250
with your tongue
dripping off your face.

449
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,875
Give me the Sleeper,
you bastard.

450
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:20,417
The Sleeper.

451
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,750
Are you sure? The side effects
can be a bit... mental.

452
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,833
Give it to me!!

453
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:48,667
Sleep tight, dickhead.

454
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:55,083
<i>The Sleeper.</i>

455
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,542
Are you sure?

456
00:38:57,583 --> 00:39:01,833
The side effects
can be a bit... mental.

457
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,500
Give it to me!

458
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:06,499
Sleep tight, dickhead.

459
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,375
Who you working with, old man?

460
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,875
You'll never crack me.

461
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,875
Forget about him, boss.

462
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:40,125
It was Lotti.
She tipped 'em off.

463
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,166
- Son. Hello.
- Hi, Mom.

464
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:01,417
- Hello.
- Mrs. H.

465
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:03,583
Hello, hello, hello.

466
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,500
Albert. A moment.

467
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:13,042
- What's up?
- Eddie found...

468
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,292
Found what?

469
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:24,333
He found some more plant food,
so we're good on inventory.

470
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:26,917
All right. Good.

471
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:34,708
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah. Why?

472
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:38,542
- Remember, I'm here if you need me, yeah?
- Yeah, I know.

473
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:47,125
- Get him out of there!
- He's dead!

474
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:50,792
Shut up!

475
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,184
We are gonna get Norman out, 'cause
a Hill does not leave a man behind.

476
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:55,375
- All right?
- Thank you.

477
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:58,059
Then I've gotta get straight with Saul,
'cause I'm gonna end up a bloody eunuch.

478
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:00,083
We're getting squeezed
from every direction.

479
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,934
We need find a way to move some of this
gold to raise the cash to pay off Saul.

480
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:05,125
- Actually, I... I can help you with that.
- Go on.

481
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:07,875
- Is this bad timing?
- Right on cue.

482
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,083
- What is she doing here?
- Just... she can help us out.

483
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,500
I can fence your gold.

484
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:16,476
How does she know
about the gold?

485
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,268
How the hell does she know
about the gold, Charlie?

486
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:20,208
Look, someone had
to take action, okay?

487
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:25,125
You're 24 hours from the pickle jar.
Just hear her out, Al.

488
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:27,643
You know there's not a fence in town
willing to take on that kind of heat.

489
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:29,250
Who said anything
about staying local?

490
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,667
Your passports up-to-date?

491
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:37,417
- Passports?
- Where we going?

492
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:39,417
New York.
