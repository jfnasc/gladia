1
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:14,375
<i>My old man, Vic Hill,</i>

2
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:17,792
is of the firm belief that
people are born fully fixed.

3
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,250
Some people are born kind,
some people are born evil,

4
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:24,542
and that he was born
just plain naughty.

5
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,125
Stay where you are!

6
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:58,667
Put down your weapon!

7
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:15,750
Off, now!

8
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,042
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

9
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,309
He's never known what it's
like to earn a straight living

10
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,083
and never had any
interest in finding out.

11
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:30,417
He'd rob banks, blow the
shutters off armored trucks,

12
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,980
and have a crack at cracking any
safe that couldn't be cracked.

13
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:44,750
Happy New Year, Dad.

14
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:49,375
Happy New Year, Albert.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,958
Looks like I'm
in the doghouse again, son.

16
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, Mum went to sleep.

17
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:02,792
I need to tell you
something, Albert,

18
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,499
and I need you to listen
very carefully.

19
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,018
You know when a kid at school has
got something that you really want,

20
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:11,309
and you spend all your time thinking about
how to get that same thing for yourself,

21
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,999
and you sit there, scratching your
noggin, plotting all the different ways

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,666
that you can earn the money to get
that BMX that you want so badly,

23
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:22,792
and you slave your
little bollocks off every day,

24
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:27,000
and you just can't seem to squirrel
away enough money to get that bike.

25
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,292
And I really wanted that bike.

26
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:33,500
Yeah, well, Albert,
there is a way to get it.

27
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,542
You just have to take it!

28
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,333
- Take it?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,667
You must not get caught.

30
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:48,083
You make sure that you're super
duper smart and cover your tracks,

31
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,500
because if you do get caught...

32
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:54,500
the bubbles will go flat
in your pop.

33
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,292
Have the bubbles gone
flat in your pop, Dad?

34
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:06,167
It seems that way.

35
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,125
Now, you... take this.

36
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,750
It's a lucky charm.
Now, go upstairs

37
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:20,958
and don't come back down
no matter what you hear.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,708
No tears, son.

39
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,542
You're a Hill,

40
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,542
and Hill's don't cry
over flat pop.

41
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,708
Go.

42
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:23,417
- Mornin', mate.
- Hello.

43
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,917
You're all right? Yeah, good.

44
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,351
- Morning, Albert.
- Hello, my love.

45
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,458
- How are you?
- Good, love.

46
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,667
Thank you!

47
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,917
Morning, Albert.

48
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,792
Hello, Eddie. It's for you.

49
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,292
- Hello, Mum.
- Morning, Albert.

50
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,666
- Good. Give me those.
- They're all overdue.

51
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,976
Bills don't pay
themselves, Albert.

52
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,417
Yeah, well, don't worry.
I'll sort it.

53
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,958
- Charlie in?
- Since we opened.

54
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,167
So have we gone
artisanal, Charlie boy?

55
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,250
Brahms and List.

56
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,292
A vanilla and cardamom infusion.

57
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,958
Wholesaling at 400% markup
on piss-cheap Serbian vodka.

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,708
And you found some tourist stupid enough
to buy all this hipster shite, have ya?

59
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,125
Come on, Charlie,
you know we need

60
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,059
as much cash as we can
to bet on Billy's fight tonight.

61
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,332
Yeah, the mixologist is my second
cousin on the Cavendish Scott side.

62
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,792
Ooh! A deal stamped in blue blood.
That imbues me with confidence.

63
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,958
Yeah, I mean, we could always just flog
it out of the back of a van again,

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,840
but that business model hasn't really
worked for us to date, has it, Al?

65
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,499
You know, when
Billy wins tonight,

66
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,332
we can start to leave all this
small-time shit behind us.

67
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,434
I mean, let's face it,
this is not sustainable, is it?

68
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,250
Head down, arms swinging out.

69
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:40,917
Yeah? All right.

70
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,059
You be a good boy and load all
that into the back of the van,

71
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,583
and I'll see you in a few.

72
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,625
What did your last peon die of?!

73
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,083
All right, Albert?

74
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,167
Morning, Patsy. I was
gonna call you today.

75
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,088
Yeah, well, I thought
I'd save you the bother.

76
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,167
Which way's the wind
blowing, Albert?

77
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,792
I do need a bit more time.

78
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,999
Come on, Patsy, I am good for it.
You know that, don't ya?

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,166
Well, I'm starting
to wonder, son.

80
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:20,166
You been tap-dancing around me quicker
than Fred Astaire on the nose candy.

81
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,542
- Listen, Patsy...
- No.

82
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,458
You listen.

83
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,750
Don't think because you're Vic Hill's
boy, I won't come down on you.

84
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:30,542
Money's owed,
and money will be paid.

85
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,333
You got until the weekend...

86
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,417
or I take a finger...

87
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,000
and the florist's.

88
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:40,667
I've always fancied
having me own concession.

89
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,625
All right, mate?

90
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,167
Keep working!

91
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,917
Hands up, all the time!

92
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,542
And a... Yeah! One-two, one-two!

93
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,125
Come in behind that left!
Beauty!

94
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,833
Would you tidy this place up, Billy?
It's a shit hole in here!

95
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,042
Don't remember exactly
inviting you over.

96
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,042
Right, and what are these?

97
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,417
Thought we had an agreement.

98
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,999
No funny business 48 hours
in the lead up to the fight.

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,667
Don't worry about it, Al.

100
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,000
I only went three rounds,
you know.

101
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:34,499
What's up with you?
You know what's up with me.

102
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,832
I told you this fight is important.
We're six unbeaten now.

103
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,832
We win tonight, I might
be able to push things forward,

104
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,999
make some proper money
for a change.

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,625
I'm sick of scraping by
hand-to-mouth, Bill.

106
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:47,042
I'm sick of living on that freezing
cold barge, you living in here.

107
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,667
I'm sorry to break it to ya,
that's every day shit.

108
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,137
So you gonna tell me
what's really going on?

109
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,300
So I'm right on the back foot with
the bills, you know that, don't ya?

110
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,735
I took out a loan against the florist to
cover 'em and now I'm late on the payments.

111
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,750
Who'd you get the money off, Al?

112
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,101
You went to Patsy. Well, listen, when
you're the offspring of Vic Hill

113
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,518
you're not exactly
welcome at the bank!

114
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:19,458
Well, does your mum know?

115
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,832
She will do when he kicks her door
down, 'cause I ain't paid him back.

116
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,792
And how much do you owe?

117
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,832
- Twenty grand.
- Twenty grand?!

118
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,375
- And counting, unfortunately.
- Jesus.

119
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,934
Anyway, I'm gonna go and do a
bit of business with Charlie.

120
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,500
I'll come grab you
before the fight.

121
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,125
Look after yourself today!

122
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:42,250
Stay hydrated.

123
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,750
See ya in a bit.

124
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,250
So which one of you Girl Scouts
is game for a little cuddle then?

125
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:12,333
Lovely lox this, Hate 'Em All.
Where'd you source it?

126
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,542
The Friendly Screw, Vic.

127
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,167
Well, he is a man
one can rely on.

128
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,458
A quality rarely seen
in our line of work these days.

129
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,042
Used to be you knew
who you knew.

130
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,208
Yeah, and stood where
you fucking stood.

131
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,434
Well, you're right,
anyway, look.

132
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,875
What you in the mood for today?

133
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:29,332
Apple or pear?

134
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,167
I think I'll go with the mix today.
Apples and pears it is then.

135
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,000
- There you are.
- Lovely.

136
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,040
Well, lighten yourself up,
Mrs. H is on the phone.

137
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,250
Fifteen years in the shovel,

138
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:50,000
and still yet to enjoy
a peaceful bit of breakfast.

139
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:52,667
I was just telling Hate 'Em
that my greatest achievement

140
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:56,458
is having you stay married to me
for all these years, Lily.

141
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,083
You got egg
on your chin, Victor.

142
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,167
Be at a loss without ya.

143
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,583
Hello, Mrs. H, yeah?

144
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,625
Hello, handsome.

145
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,917
So, what's the gossip, Lil?

146
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,417
Just everything shipshape
for Johnny Reid's big send-off.

147
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,875
- We make a few quid out of it?
<i>- Hardly.</i>

148
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:11,708
But all money
is good money, right, love?

149
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,708
Good luck to him
at the pearly gates.

150
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,351
Wonder if St. Peter will take a bung
and let him in, the vicious bastard.

151
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,875
Is that Albert?

152
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,000
I haven't heard from him
in a couple of weeks.

153
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,832
<i>- He's a busy boy.</i>
- Busy with what?

154
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,167
Flogging moonshine?

155
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,583
Busy doing what he can
to keep us above water.

156
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,666
It's not roses
at the minute, Vic.

157
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:33,208
Albert needs to understand that this
small-time stuff is simply not sustainable.

158
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,125
More chances to get nicked.

159
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,542
If he's gonna play the game,
he needs to go in heavy.

160
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,167
Come on, you were still trying
to find your feet at his age.

161
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,375
Yeah, but I had ambition.

162
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,434
So does Albert, he's managing
Billy's fight career.

163
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,309
He's gotten him a decent
ticket tonight as it happens.

164
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,500
Billy's fighting tonight?
Where's that, then?

165
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,708
You keep your beak
out of it, Vic Hill.

166
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,332
Any chance of a viewing, Lil?

167
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,708
Come on, I could really do
with a good night in.

168
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,018
No, I wasn't planning on going.

169
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,792
I don't like seeing
Billy fighting.

170
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,708
Ooh, you could put on
that red dress I really like,

171
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:02,375
the one with the low-cut front.

172
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,667
Show 'em all what I'm missing.

173
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,768
Turn it. What's the matter? I'm
trying to have me breakfast.

174
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,083
You daft sod.

175
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,499
I'm only daft for you,
sweetheart.

176
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,083
I'm only daft for you.

177
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,208
Hey, Vic?

178
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,542
Did you know that the robin redbreast is
actually five and 3/4 inches in length?

179
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,499
El Flamingo?

180
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,375
Did you fall off your
rocking horse, Charlie?

181
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:36,332
Everyone knows this place
is fronted by Sonny Castillo.

182
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:40,042
<i>And that insane, wannabe Cuban
has a zero tolerance policy</i>

183
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,018
for any liberties of any description
being taken inside his establishment.

184
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,458
It's urban legend, Al.

185
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,083
Sonny Castillo is
a legitimate businessman.

186
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:17,500
I'm not an accountant, Sonny,
but I can count heads,

187
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:20,458
and we had a club
full last night.

188
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,667
That was down to me.

189
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,708
We made a deal.

190
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:28,833
Ten percent of the takings,
and this is not ten percent!

191
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,000
Always with the drama, Lotti.

192
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:38,500
You need to center
your fire, baby girl.

193
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,292
Yeah.

194
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,750
You're right.

195
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,208
I'll torch this place
to the ground with you in it.

196
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,333
Hey, hey!

197
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:58,667
You make me wanna salsa.

198
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,332
I swear to God,
you got to have Cuban blood.

199
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,625
Give me what you owe me, you
pig, or I'll leave you so fast.

200
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:08,958
No one leaves Santiago Castillo.

201
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,958
Now...

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,832
You be a good girl.

203
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,958
Go shopping, and buy
yourself something...

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,375
transparent to wear tonight.

205
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,750
Okay, baby.

206
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,792
I'll turn some heads.

207
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:49,042
And now, the distillation process
takes place in stainless steel vats

208
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,125
for over several months.

209
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:54,292
The, timing
of the distillation is as such...

210
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,999
Oi, what is it with you boys
and your bullshit?

211
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,958
Just pour the shit.

212
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:03,143
Where's Charlie's cousin? Just always
expected to be dealing with him directly.

213
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,917
He got caught with his dirty, thieving
fingers in the till last night.

214
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,042
Lil' Manny here had a chin-wag with
him, threw him out with the empties.

215
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,375
Well, you know, he was always
the black sheep of the family.

216
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,417
Pour.

217
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,875
You got a good pour.

218
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,833
That smells like shit.

219
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,333
Give me that, Beanie.

220
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,083
Cardamom vanilla.

221
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,083
You've got some bollocks.

222
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,875
Yeah, well, if it's
not to your liking,

223
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:49,208
we can be on our way, can't we?
Not to my liking? It's inspired.

224
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,958
Inspired?

225
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,292
Well, that's good, right?

226
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,583
How many cases do you have?

227
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,083
Dozen out in the van.

228
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,875
We'll take the lot.

229
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,208
Pay these boys.

230
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:06,333
Cash works, fellas.

231
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,166
Well, that went
to plan, didn't it?

232
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,333
"Went to plan," you penis?

233
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,583
We were seconds away from getting
the carpet treatment in there.

234
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,393
I just made us two grand. When are
you gonna give me a pat on the back?

235
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,666
When you start adding some
risk-averse value to this operation.

236
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,332
"Risk-averse value"?

237
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,809
I think you might want to reconsider
our chosen line of work, Al.

238
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,375
You know it was never
a choice for me.

239
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,684
Yeah, and I was born with
a silver spoon up my ass, right?

240
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,125
- I didn't say that, Charlie.
- Didn't have to.

241
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,208
I know what you and Billy think.

242
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,500
"Charlie, he's not the offspring of a
bank robber or a bare-knuckle fighter.

243
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:39,726
No, he couldn't possibly know his
way around "a bit of business."

244
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,750
I don't have time for this now!

245
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,893
We have to concentrate on finding more folding
to put down on Billy's fight tonight!

246
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:47,667
This ain't gonna cut it, and you
know that mental case, Patsy

247
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,667
is gonna be sharpening his garden
scissors and dreaming of daffodils.

248
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,832
Where you going? Charlie?

249
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,333
Charlie, where you going?

250
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,792
To dip my fingers
in the family coffers,

251
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,417
so you can remain
in possession of all of yours.

252
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
You're Albert Hill.

253
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,042
Vic Hill's son, right?

254
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,125
That's right.

255
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,917
Thought you'd have more about you
than flogging rebottled piss water.

256
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,333
But then again...

257
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,518
maybe you're just like all the
other losers in this neighborhood.

258
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:20,018
And you're fulfilling
your dreams, are you?

259
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:23,332
Knocking about
with Sonny Castillo?

260
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,708
I haven't even started
to live my dreams, yet, mate.

261
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,166
All right, nobody move a muscle.

262
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,917
Vic, we got three bars here.

263
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,393
Don't do drugs, Albert,
you'll end up in prison.

264
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,208
Drugs are really expensive
in prison.

265
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,434
- Well, I'll bear that in mind, Dad.
<i>- Listen, I've had a think.</i>

266
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,499
Gonna work the odds
on Billy Boy's fight tonight.

267
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,851
- How'd you know about Billy's fight?
<i>- Have him smack the fella</i>

268
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,726
around for three rounds
without putting him away.

269
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,332
The odds are gonna shorten on the
win, so we go in heavy on a loss.

270
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,500
Have Billy catch a cold
in the fourth. Boom.

271
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:14,542
No, I'm not having
Billy take a fall. No way!

272
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,018
I'm trying to build
something here, Dad.

273
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:19,208
Okay. I appreciate that...
but it's page one.

274
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:22,226
When the odds are there to be worked, we
work 'em. Gonna make a packet out of this.

275
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,101
Get back to your winning ways
the next go around.

276
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,083
I've got ten grand stashed with
Clive at the battle cruiser.

277
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,750
Go and grab it,
and put it on the wager.

278
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,809
And since when did you have
ten grand stashed at the pub?

279
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,500
Rainy day readies.

280
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:33,708
You forget I'm a bank robber?

281
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,208
Get your head straight, son.

282
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,625
Billy goes down in the fourth.

283
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,208
Bollocks!

284
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,708
Dad just called me.

285
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,625
- Did he now?
- Knows about the fight.

286
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,167
Wants Billy to take a fall.

287
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,042
Told me we'd "make
a packet out of it."

288
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,167
- And what did you say?
- What do you think I said?

289
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,226
He didn't give me a chance to say anything,
did he? You know what he gets like.

290
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,583
Your dad sees things
in simple terms, love.

291
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,875
If there's a bulletproof way to turn
over a pound, he'll take it every time.

292
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,237
Well, that equaled out perfectly
for all of us, didn't it?

293
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,458
Don't be too tough on him, love.

294
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,875
I mean, he's just... trying to
stay relevant. "Stay relevant?"

295
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,934
What about me? I'm just trying
to get fucking relevant.

296
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,583
- Language, Albert.
- No, Mum!

297
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,518
We've been up against it
ever since Dad got nicked.

298
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,832
Unpaid bills up to our ears! We
haven't had any help from anyone!

299
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,499
You're still peddling fake designer shirts,
and look at me, I'm still wearing 'em.

300
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,101
Dad put us in this situation in the
first place, and he thinks he can just

301
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,518
call me up and get me to do whatever
he wants whenever he wants.

302
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:41,542
Was that a statement
or a question, Albert?

303
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,958
'Cause what I see
is a young man,

304
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,458
and he should be making
his own choices.

305
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,833
Yeah.

306
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:10,917
Hello, Staff.! Good
afternoon, Master Charles.

307
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,750
Are my parents home?

308
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,708
Well, if you mean "parents"
in the biological context,

309
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,999
pertaining to an organism, cell,
or complex molecular structure

310
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,999
that generates
or produces another, then yes,

311
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,417
your "parents" are indeed...
in residence.

312
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,292
Thank you, Staff.

313
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,708
Afternoon, Charlie.

314
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,792
Everything ticking along
all right, old chap?

315
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,667
Head down,
arms swinging, Father.

316
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,083
Good boy.

317
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,101
Do me a favor, would you,
and pop into the bedroom

318
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,292
and remind your mother
that the plumber was called out

319
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:07,999
to disencumber...
the pipes and not her.

320
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,417
Okay.

321
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,625
TMI. Jesus.

322
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:23,917
Christ.

323
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:47,809
Work the odds
a little bit, Alby.

324
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,499
We'll make a packet
out of it, Alby.

325
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,250
Course Billy
goes down in the fourth,

326
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:53,434
'cause you have to run my life
from inside the nick, don't ya?

327
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,309
He ain't going down. Why does
he go down in the fourth?

328
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,351
He ain't gonna take a dive, you
ain't gonna shorten the odds,

329
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,708
he ain't going down
in the fourth.

330
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,958
Not going down in the...

331
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:04,917
All right, Albert?

332
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,458
Vic called, said
you'd be dropping by.

333
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,220
And like a rabbit
out of a hat, here I am.

334
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:13,167
Any thoughts on the fight, son?

335
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,833
Too close to call, Clive.

336
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:34,958
Good afternoon.

337
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,417
And how may I be of assistance?

338
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,750
Um, S-Saul Gold, please.

339
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:44,000
Mr. Gold is occupied,
but I'd be more than happy

340
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:45,958
to help you with any
inquiry you may have.

341
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,542
Inquiry, yeah, I may have...

342
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,875
Right, , yeah, um...

343
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:54,125
yeah.

344
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:59,875
Um, I have a very rare,
gold, antique fob watch.

345
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:02,333
Mint condition.

346
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:05,708
Been in my family,
the Cavendish-Scotts,

347
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:08,666
for over four generations.

348
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,167
Um, I'd like an appraisal
for a potential sale.

349
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,958
It's sub-mint, as indicated
here by the wear on the bezel.

350
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,083
The weight of the watch is 100
grams, so mass value is nominal.

351
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:27,292
Not antique, but placed into
the mid-century modern era.

352
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:31,500
The fob watch is not a style that
is in vogue in the current market.

353
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:36,125
So, we could make you a purchase
price offer of 3,000 pounds.

354
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:44,083
Would that be satisfactory, sir?

355
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:48,667
Yeah, what? How-how much? Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that-that-that-that's satisfactory.

356
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,833
Pleasure doing business with you, Mr.
Cavendish-Scott.

357
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:05,333
Go in. Ask her out.

358
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:08,250
Or call her later? Now? Later?

359
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:09,708
Too soon?

360
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:12,333
Too soon.

361
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,000
Billy, I wanna run
something past ya.

362
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:35,625
It's about the fight.
And what about it?

363
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:39,250
Well, I've been thinking... you know
if we work the odds on this a bit,

364
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:41,772
well, you know, we can make a
packet out of it. Work the odds?

365
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:44,500
I ain't taking a dive, Al.

366
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:46,167
- Not a chance.
- Listen, Billy.

367
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,625
You know I'd never
ask you to do that.

368
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,125
So what're you asking then?

369
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:59,833
Take a few slaps
in the first three rounds.

370
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,684
Right, we let the odds lengthen
on you winning,

371
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,332
we lay down our bet, and you poleaxe
this prick in the fourth round.

372
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,832
You want me to do
the rope-a-dope?

373
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:09,913
I know it's a lot to ask of ya, but I'm
right on the back foot here, ain't I?

374
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:15,125
I do this...
and our problem goes away?

375
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,458
Like it never happened.

376
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,833
- All right, then.
- Yeah?

377
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:24,000
What, seriously?!

378
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,792
Well, you know I've never been
shy about taking a few digs, Al.

379
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,667
- Come here.
- Oi, easy there!

380
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:30,500
Feint! Protect
yourself at all times.

381
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:31,833
You're lucky!

382
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,458
And what?

383
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,875
Albert Hill!

384
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:49,667
What's occurring, Blud? This and
that, Tip Top, you know me.

385
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:53,792
So, is your half-Pikey pal
ready for a proper tear up?

386
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,167
What do you think?

387
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:06,292
Fighter weighs in at 162 pounds.

388
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,500
You promised us
a "proper ding dong" Tip Top.

389
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,042
We're fighting Castillo's boy.

390
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,723
Keep your head straight, Billy, all right?
Keep your head straight.

391
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,750
I'm comin' for you!

392
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,083
It's fight night!

393
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:57,083
Come on, Al.

394
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,750
You've wrapped me
three times already.

395
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:01,073
Yeah, well, these babies
are our ticket to the big time.

396
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,500
- All right, girls?
- There he is.

397
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:07,417
Where've you been? Getting
your bottom spanked by Staff?

398
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,999
No, raising funds to extract
your broke ass from the gutter.

399
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,625
- Yeah, all right.
- A "little risk-averse value."

400
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,332
Three bags to up the ante.

401
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,792
Three grand? Shit.

402
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:23,833
Fair play, Charlie Boy.

403
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,832
Fifteen grand, all right?

404
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:31,667
All of it to go down
on Billy to win in the fourth.

405
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:34,458
And don't put it down till the
end of round three, we good?

406
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,625
Good as gold.

407
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:43,958
Oi.

408
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,833
Round four.

409
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,542
- Fourth round.
- Right.

410
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,583
- Hate 'Em?
- Yeah?

411
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,167
- Fight time.
- Fine.

412
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,833
I'll be back for you,
little man.

413
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:57,309
Keep them custard creams on ice
for me, all right? Yeah, right.

414
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,253
All right, let's get
the old lady on the phone.

415
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,375
Hey.

416
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,667
Sit right here, baby.

417
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,000
- All right, love?
- Hello, beautiful.

418
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:14,667
You get us some ringside seats?

419
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:17,750
Well, the Hill name still holds
some sway around here, babe.

420
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,333
Check this out.

421
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,250
Come on!
You're the man! You got this!

422
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,500
Billy Boy!

423
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,792
Okay, let's have some fun!

424
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,167
Center of the ring,
please, boys.

425
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,500
Right. I want a good,
clean fight.

426
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,417
Leave the monkey business
in the zoo.

427
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:05,458
To your corners.
To your corners!

428
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:10,101
Boys, can you keep
the noise down?

429
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,042
The fight's about
to start. Sweet.

430
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:16,282
Listen to me, stick to the
plan, and we're home and dry.

431
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,393
Stick to the plan, all right?

432
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:19,292
No knockout until
the fourth, yeah?

433
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,500
Right, that's
when he's getting it.

434
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:23,332
I hope he remembers to go down.

435
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,708
He'll go down.

436
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,417
Go, Billy!

437
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,708
Come on!

438
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:48,375
Come on, Chepe!

439
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,750
- Referee, he's holding now!
- He's holding!

440
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,708
Referee!

441
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,167
Slow down, Billy Boy.

442
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,000
Have a live wire
in that boy, innit?

443
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:23,708
Yeah, Billy Boy, you know the script.
You know the script.

444
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,875
Ref! Wake up!

445
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,708
What are you doing in there?!

446
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,083
- I barely touched him.
- Well, touch him less.

447
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,750
Less touching, please.

448
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,333
Touch him, touch him!

449
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:08,672
- Too early, too early.
- I know, but he's makin' it look good, isn't he?

450
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,167
Nice! Come on!

451
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:40,792
- No.
- No.

452
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,433
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

453
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:45,667
Come on, Billy!

454
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,417
Oi!

455
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:03,166
After the bell, that.

456
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:06,487
- Round four, we're done, we're done. We're home dry.
- Sweet, this is it, we're in.

457
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,167
How you feeling?

458
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:15,667
- Good as gold, Al.
- Yeah?

459
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,125
What action you offering
Billy Ayers in the fourth?

460
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:20,417
It's a carpet.
Three to one odds.

461
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:23,750
- Fifteen large.
- Fifteen large?

462
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:25,542
Do I stutter?

463
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:28,223
Well, I'll have to go up the totem
pole to get an aye on this one.

464
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,917
I will take your folding,
big bollocks.

465
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,667
- Lovely.
- Nice one.

466
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:50,499
Fourth round, Bill.
Fourth round, Bill?

467
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,458
Put him on his ass.

468
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,875
- Come on, Billy, you know what to do.
- You got this, Bill.

469
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,792
- Billy!
- No!

470
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:08,833
No!

471
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:09,833
What is he doing?!

472
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:12,042
Billy! Billy! Come on then!

473
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,583
- One.
- Get up.

474
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,042
Two.

475
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,375
Three.

476
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:20,917
Four.
I need you to get up, Chepe.

477
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,375
Come on, come on!

478
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:25,250
- Six.
- Are you counting down or what?

479
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,013
- Seven.
- Are you counting there or what?!

480
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,292
Nine.

481
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:33,333
Move it.

482
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:36,833
Box!

483
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,125
Shit!

484
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:44,499
Ref! He's gouging his eye there!

485
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
- He gouged his eye!
- He thumbed his eye!

486
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,000
Sit your ass down.

487
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,542
Ho, ho, ho!

488
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:57,667
Yeah!

489
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,250
- Boom!
- There he is!

490
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,500
- Bye-bye, good night.
- Stay down.

491
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:17,167
One, two, three, four...

492
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,166
- Billy, stand up!
- Five!

493
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:23,666
Six.

494
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,625
Seven.

495
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,667
Bill! Get your ass up!

496
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:29,750
- Eight!
- Eight!

497
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:35,750
Nine!

498
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:37,375
No.

499
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:46,500
Chepe Vago is the winner by TKO!

500
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,000
Son!

501
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:07,833
Oi! Hey, what's your game now?

502
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:09,292
Ten seconds, can you count?

503
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:10,976
Waving off after nine,
what's your problem?

504
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,417
- That's it mate, that's it.
- You're a mug, you're a mug!

505
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:25,167
Whoo! Whoo!

506
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,500
Let's get out of here.

507
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:39,708
I mean, he turned us over!
Castillo properly turned us over!

508
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:41,500
All that money, Billy, gone.

509
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,833
Shit!

510
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,809
We're fucked! Yeah, and not
to mention the small issue

511
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,833
that Vic Hill thinks
he just won a small fortune.

512
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,268
I'm well aware that I'm now 30
grand in the hole to my old man.

513
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:58,708
Thank you very much, Charlie. Yeah, well, I
say we go back there and lodge a protest.

514
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,083
Let's go back and kick
the shit out of him.

515
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,250
Hey!

516
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,542
All right, boys?

517
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:23,333
What do you want?

518
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,333
Sonny hustled you guys.

519
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:29,083
- I think you mean your boyfriend hustled us.
- Soon to be ex-boyfriend.

520
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,792
Time to move along.

521
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,666
Your eye all right, tough guy?

522
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:35,000
Still in its socket.

523
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:36,583
You haven't answered
my question.

524
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:39,250
It was me who turned
El Flamingo from a dive bar

525
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:40,875
into the hottest
spot around here.

526
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:45,792
Sonny's been shortchanging me
out of my cut for months.

527
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,750
I want what's mine.

528
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:50,542
My guess is you want
what's yours.

529
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,917
Thought we could help each other.
Go on.

530
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:57,042
Sonny's got a collection
going out this morning.

531
00:36:57,083 --> 00:37:02,332
5:00 a.m. A security van picks up this
month's takings from El Flamingo.

532
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:07,332
I'm talking couple
of hundred grand?

533
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:11,166
I give you the route, you figure out
the best place to hit the truck.

534
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:12,999
"Hit the truck"?

535
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,250
And what makes you think we'd be
stupid enough to rob Sonny Castillo?

536
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:19,625
Maybe the rumors
about you are right.

537
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:22,083
The apple did fall
far from the tree.

538
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:25,333
But if you boys
decide to man up...

539
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:29,417
I'm only 11 digits away.

540
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:45,332
We've gotta go after him, Al.

541
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:49,458
I can't just sit on my hands. For once,
I think I actually agree with Billy.

542
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,332
And you think you've got the minerals to
hold up a security van, do you, Charlie?

543
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:54,125
Actually, yeah, I think I might.

544
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:56,476
Yeah, well, Sonny Castillo is a
proper nut, and if we get this wrong?

545
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,518
We are bang in trouble, and I'm talkin' "two
in the back of the head" kind of trouble.

546
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:00,833
What do you think Vic'd do?

547
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,375
We all know what Vic would do!

548
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:04,917
This entire neighborhood
knows what Vic Hill would do!

549
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,200
Now, you wanna go and do a 20 stretch in
the nick, you go and knock yourself out.

550
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,500
Get inside, boys, come on.

551
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:26,958
There's no shame
in what happened tonight, Billy.

552
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,208
You had him beat,
and you were robbed.

553
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:31,333
Bloody robbed.

554
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:36,125
I'm, sorry about
the towels, Mrs. H.

555
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:38,792
Don't you worry, love.
You know it's not the first time

556
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:43,083
I've had to clear up a mess in this house.
Most likely won't be the last.

557
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:46,792
Albert?

558
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,125
Kitchen.

559
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:53,625
So I take it you bet on the win.

560
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,976
Yeah, and we would have won
if we hadn't been turned over.

561
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,042
Somebody's always getting turned
over in this game, Albert,

562
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,500
you should know that by now.

563
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,666
Well, I feel like
I'm losing control, right?

564
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:08,018
Paddlin' upstream, trying to steer
things in the right direction,

565
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:10,333
and as soon as I feel
like I'm gettin' somewhere...

566
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:12,833
Everything turns to shit.

567
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,167
Yeah.

568
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,708
Why is it so hard to get ahead?

569
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,875
Why?

570
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:26,958
Listen.

571
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:32,208
I know life has dealt you
a tough hand,

572
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,958
but it is what it is,

573
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,042
and we are where we are,

574
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,417
and the only part of it
you can control

575
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,332
is how you react to the
crap that is thrown at you.

576
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,832
So, you can either be a mark,

577
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,833
or make a mark, Albert.

578
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:52,125
No one can make
that choice for you.

579
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:56,667
I'm gonna turn in.

580
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,417
Get up, boys.

581
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:22,750
We're gonna hit that truck.

582
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:13,625
Two trucks?!

583
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:17,583
Think, think!

584
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:26,542
Shit!

585
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:36,583
Right. Let's be having ya!

586
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,708
No, you bloody well don't!

587
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:18,125
What's that?

588
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,500
We've rung the bell.

589
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:33,042
Charlie... can you bring
the van 'round, please, mate?

590
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:38,625
That's gangsta!
