1
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:08,000
Your dad's out.

2
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,184
Busted out with Hate 'Em All
this afternoon.

3
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,750
He's broken out to get the gold.

4
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,559
Get him off the street.
Just get him off the street.

5
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,333
They've blow-piped us, Hate 'Em.

6
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,042
Well, well, well, look what
the pussycat dragged in.

7
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,999
You'll get nothing from me!

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,434
Do you think your friend
Albert Hill

9
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:21,684
would take the same
punishment for you?

10
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,166
- I do.
- Nas Stone is coming to London.

11
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:25,500
We're happy about this why?

12
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,167
He wants the rest
of the gold, Albert.

13
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,667
He says he'll take all of it.

14
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:30,958
Vic?

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,167
Bob?

16
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,292
You don't know, do you?

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,958
Know what?

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,042
Yeah, Bobby Adams' gang.

19
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,750
I knew it. I bloody knew it!

20
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,375
When I bought this place
off Jonesy five years back,

21
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,000
he said, "Tommy,
I've had some dealings"

22
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:48,542
with a bit of a naughty crew."

23
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,375
"Nasty types," he says.

24
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,666
Used to come down here
for all manner of mischief.

25
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:54,583
Last year, they
buggered off to Spain.

26
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,833
Let the heat die down
after something big.

27
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,458
Here you go.

28
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:13,333
Yeah. Yeah, it fits the intel.

29
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,708
Yeah, you did the right thing,
calling this in.

30
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,000
Truth is, I did some homework.

31
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:21,417
It says, "If no claim is made to
articles found at the property",

32
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,750
ownership rights refer
to the landowner."

33
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,542
- That's me, right?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:29,208
That is you indeed, sir.

35
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,083
Give us a hand to bring it up,
will you?

36
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:32,208
Yeah, all right.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,167
Sir... I found something I think
you should take a look at.

38
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,792
Mornin', pal.

39
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,625
Bit chilly last night?

40
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,500
The shelter's just opened
on Dexter Street.

41
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,833
Weren't much of a queue there
when I went past.

42
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,417
Get a bit of breakfast...

43
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,458
and a shower before
the rush starts.

44
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,542
Here...

45
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,083
Get yourself a bacon roll
and cuppa

46
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,565
before you go back
on the hard stuff.

47
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't you know who I am?

48
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,333
I'm Vic Hill!

49
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,832
This... is my manor.

50
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,542
And this... is my rubbish.

51
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,833
So piss off.

52
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,666
No sign of him.

53
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,500
Well... well, you just
get back out there, Albert,

54
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:20,958
and keep looking for him.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,143
Look, I been traipsing
around the neighborhood

56
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,542
looking for him all night, okay?

57
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,393
I got my own shit to deal with.
He's a big boy.

58
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:26,893
I'm not gonna follow him around
with a mop anymore, all right?

59
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:28,393
No, that's not okay...
Your father is out there

60
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,542
on the street, on his own,
and he's not safe!

61
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,976
Okay, well, let's say I do
manage to track him down.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,875
Then what, you want me
to dart him again?

63
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:35,309
Maybe this time
I'll run him over with the van.

64
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,667
Have you considered, just once,

65
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,143
that Dad is not the bloke
you think he is?

66
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:39,851
He's a selfish prick
that doesn't give a fuck

67
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,333
about either one of us!

68
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't worry about it.

69
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:46,333
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

70
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,833
Albert...

71
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,542
Scooter.

72
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,625
If I ever get out of here,

73
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,458
I'm gonna make a few changes.

74
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,542
I'm gonna be more dependable.

75
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,332
You talking to the fairies,
Charlie?

76
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,333
Piss off!

77
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:23,166
Look here.

78
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,333
There's no need for
that kind of hostility.

79
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,458
This is a good time
of your own making.

80
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,625
I fail to see
how being snatched,

81
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:31,832
chained up, and beaten
by a delusional psychopath

82
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,333
is anyone's idea of a good time.

83
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:34,750
What you need to do is point me

84
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:37,250
in the direction
of my heart's desire.

85
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,499
If your information bears fruit,

86
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,125
I'll release you
from these shackles

87
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:44,625
and furnish on you a finder's
fee of, let's say...

88
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,542
ten percent?

89
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,500
You can propel your finders fee
where the sun don't shine.

90
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,625
Looks like I'm gonna
have to give you

91
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,625
a professional kicking
this time.

92
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,875
Yeah.

93
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:01,833
But first... breakfast!

94
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,792
Don't get any bright ideas.

95
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,167
I'll be back in two shakes

96
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,333
of a lamb's tail.

97
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:21,832
Nas is in a taxi
on the way from the airport.

98
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,625
He's here in London, Albert.

99
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:24,917
Good, so where's the meet?

100
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,375
Well, I can't
take him to Saul's,

101
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,042
so I'm meeting him
in the market.

102
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,500
He'll be here in 20 minutes.

103
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:30,500
I'm on my way.

104
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:31,750
Okay.

105
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,458
Come on, big guy,
pick up... pick up.

106
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:38,500
Hate 'Em, where the hell
have you been?

107
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,042
You match fit?

108
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,083
Vic, now, I'm a little bit
confused here.

109
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:49,000
What exactly happened?

110
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:52,875
We got darted, Hate 'Em.

111
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:56,332
Like wild animals
on the savannah.

112
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,792
They wanted us
out of the picture.

113
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,166
Who wanted us out
of the picture?

114
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,292
Albert, Lily.

115
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,333
Albert and Lily?

116
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:02,833
Don't be stupid.

117
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:04,167
Well, it appears

118
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,476
I have indeed
been stupid, Hate 'Em.

119
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,042
Very stupid indeed.

120
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,292
They got used to me
not being around,

121
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,417
Lily all cozied up with Norman,

122
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,958
and Albert wanting
to be top dog.

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,083
And... I reckon
they have the gold, Hate 'Em.

124
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,917
Or at least had it.

125
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,832
But I can't prove it.

126
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,583
I don't have all the pieces
of the jigsaw... yet.

127
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,832
So what you're saying now, Vic,
is that we're actually

128
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,667
hunting jigsaw pieces, yeah?

129
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,833
Metaphorically speaking.

130
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,666
So... seeing as how

131
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,250
I can't go after my own son,

132
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:47,292
we're gonna start with
the weakest link.

133
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,917
An old pal of Albert's.

134
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,333
So, you tidy yourself up.

135
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,375
We're gonna pay a visit
to the upper crust.

136
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,958
I'll make you right, Vic.

137
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:34,667
Norman.

138
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,375
I just don't get it.

139
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,792
Chair's not broken,
rope's not cut.

140
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,292
Someone must have untied him.
Come off it, Lil.

141
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,708
We tied him to a chair
and locked him in a garden shed.

142
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,666
The man had just broken out
of a high-security prison.

143
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,958
Honestly, I don't know
what we were thinking.

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,999
I know, all I'm saying is...

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,500
if he'd done it himself,

146
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,042
the chair would be broke
and the rope would be cut.

147
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,750
What does it matter
how he got free, Lily?

148
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,250
Well, he's gone now.

149
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:05,333
Got only knows where he is.

150
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,083
I will not
have my family estranged

151
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,458
for another 15 years, Norman.

152
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,750
So where is he?

153
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,208
He's not here yet.

154
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,667
Strike that!

155
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:33,750
He's not too subtle, your mate.

156
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,792
What? Yo! Yo! That's my wallet!

157
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,500
- Whoa.
- Yo! Hey! Hey!

158
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,125
Welcome to London.

159
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,125
I am so sorry, Nas.

160
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,375
Sorry? For what?

161
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:03,042
First foot on the ground and I'm
into some Oliver Twist shit.

162
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,125
I love this town!

163
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:06,833
Lovely, shall we
get going, then?

164
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,542
No, business can wait.

165
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:12,042
Ain't every day I get to visit
my favorite metropolis.

166
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,250
I gotta soak it up.

167
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,042
Hey, man! Yo!

168
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,500
Hey.

169
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,125
Hyuh!

170
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:41,042
Charlie's residence.

171
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,750
Are you shitting me?

172
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,167
I shit you not.

173
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,166
Check upstairs, mate.

174
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,625
Sweet.

175
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,166
En garde, you cad.

176
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:16,042
Fah fah fah fah fah fah
fah fah fah fah fah fah fah.

177
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,958
- What's that?
- Music.

178
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:59,083
Drop the iron and put
your hands where I can see 'em.

179
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,792
Slowly does it.

180
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,917
You're going to be disappointed.

181
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,417
The family coffers
were emptied long ago.

182
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,750
Bequeathed
to various pawnbrokers

183
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,917
by an esteemed line
of forebears.

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,375
We're not here
for the silverware, mate.

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,542
Then I'm not entirely sure
how I can help you.

186
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,625
I can assure you that
no one will pay my ransom.

187
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,000
Get over here.

188
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,458
You talk too much.

189
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,333
Stay down. Stay!

190
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,375
Now...

191
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:44,250
where is Charles?

192
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:47,833
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to discuss the whereabouts

193
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,458
of my employers.

194
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,917
I was actually hoping
you'd say that.

195
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Now, where is he?!

196
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,041
Ripe!

197
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:02,500
Dried fruit!

198
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:03,875
A challenging nose.

199
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,999
Make yourself comfortable, Vic.

200
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,458
I think this is gonna
take a while.

201
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,458
Stay still! Where is he?

202
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Tell me.

203
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,167
Where is he? Where is he?

204
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,583
Stop it! Where is he?

205
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,583
Where is he? Where is he?

206
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,958
You hit like a girl, sir.

207
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,667
Bob, what you fail
to understand is

208
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,375
I may well be a girl...

209
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:39,875
but I'm the meanest girl
on the playground.

210
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,833
And you, heh...
you, you naughty boy.

211
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,166
You've been running round
my playground

212
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,958
causing quite a mess.

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,125
Agh.

214
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:54,083
Where is it?
Where's the gold, Bob?

215
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,583
Teri...

216
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,750
did you know...

217
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,792
Did I know what, Bob?

218
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,292
Did you know...

219
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,417
you can never lose
a homing pigeon?

220
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,875
If your homing pigeon
doesn't come back,

221
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:11,917
what you've lost...

222
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,625
is a pigeon.

223
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,167
If I so much as hear
your name whispered

224
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,000
in relation to this case again,

225
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:24,333
I'll find you,
and I will put an end

226
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,332
to the quip that is Bob Fink.

227
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,667
Understood. Sir.

228
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,500
Sling him out.

229
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,958
Aaaah!

230
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,750
Ha ha! Yeah!

231
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:50,042
This is some authenticated
Brit shit right here!

232
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,083
Ha ha!

233
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,250
Is he taking us
for a ride or what?

234
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:58,101
Let him get some new duds.
He'll feel a million bucks,

235
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,625
and we'll take him
to Uncle Dean's.

236
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,059
I wanna know what
a million bucks feels like.

237
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,750
You will. Be patient.

238
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,167
Jimmy, Nas Stone.
Nas, Jimmy the Chalk.

239
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,792
Who the what?

240
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,625
What sort of getup
does sir want to be fitted?

241
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:16,832
Help me out here, brother.

242
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,083
What kind of suit do you want?

243
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,792
Three-button hunting jacket

244
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,125
in an over-check twill tweed,

245
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,434
bold pattern
with the vest and the...

246
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,750
Matching plus fours, sir?

247
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:30,417
My man!

248
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,958
So, how long is this shit

249
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,500
gonna take to stitch up, Jimmy?

250
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,792
Um... two days, sir.

251
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,667
Two hours, you said?

252
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,042
Two hours, sir.

253
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,333
You're making more friends,
I see, Bob.

254
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,000
You're a curious one, Charlie.

255
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,875
Born into a family of note.

256
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,667
With all the opportunities
that blue blood

257
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,999
coursing through your veins
offers a young man.

258
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,792
Yet you... you choose
to knock about

259
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,083
with a gangster's kid.

260
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,333
And an orphan.

261
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,875
Seems to me you're punching
under your weight, mate.

262
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,042
You haven't got an inkling

263
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,875
of who I am
or what I want to be.

264
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:58,250
You see, that's
where you're wrong.

265
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,583
I see you very clearly.

266
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:05,875
'Cause I used to be
walking in your shoes.

267
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:09,750
Yeah... I, like you,
was seduced by the Hill family.

268
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,875
Extending myself
for crumbs of acceptance.

269
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:14,832
Wanting to be a part
of the inner circle,

270
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:19,332
longing, long for a firm
pat on the back.

271
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,917
But let me tell you
from experience,

272
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,833
the simple,
"Well done, Charlie"...

273
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:28,625
it'll never come.

274
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:32,625
You're not a Hill.
You never will be.

275
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:35,792
To Albert, you're just
a posh twat...

276
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,750
who's there to be used
and tossed aside

277
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,333
when your novelty wears thin.

278
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,667
Albert is my friend.

279
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,708
No.

280
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,833
I am your friend.

281
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,542
And I need you
to accept me as such.

282
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,833
Or I will presuppose
you're my enemy.

283
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:58,625
And if you're my enemy...

284
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,000
well...

285
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:02,875
Don't you touch me!

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,917
What's got into you, Scooter?

287
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:12,292
What's got into you, boy?

288
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,208
So our guest's been
flirting with you, has he?

289
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,625
Course... breakfast, buddy.

290
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,125
It slipped my mind.

291
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,500
Aaagh!

292
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,917
Dog food, Bob!

293
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,750
Dog food, Bob!

294
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,375
Bloody psycho.

295
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,708
Not intruding, am I?

296
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,499
It's your house, Norman.

297
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,625
It's us who's intruding.

298
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:21,625
Lily, you are always
welcome in this house.

299
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,417
What is it, Norman?

300
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,167
Christ.

301
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,250
I...

302
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:35,917
I did it for you, Lily.

303
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,250
You and Albert.

304
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:39,875
What precisely
have you done, Norman?

305
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,083
It was me, Lily.

306
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,750
I untied him, I let Vic go.

307
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,333
Why would you do that?

308
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,292
Lily, you've got to realize
I did this for you.

309
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,250
I couldn't just stand by him,

310
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,208
witness him tear
his family apart, again.

311
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,375
I... I see how he treats you,

312
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,625
what he expects of you,
and I'm meant to just

313
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:05,042
sit back and watch you,
the most exquisite flower,

314
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,375
wilting with neglect,
poisoned by his selfishness!

315
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,292
Stop, Norm. Just stop it.

316
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,999
The gold is more important
to him than his family.

317
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,083
It always has been,
but you must realize...

318
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,559
- Just... just stop it!
- I... I would never treat you...

319
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,583
All right? Just stop.

320
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:20,542
Now, I'm gonna have to make this
absolutely clear.

321
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,375
For you, me, Vic, and Albert,

322
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:26,583
there can't be any confusion.

323
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,417
Vic is my husband,
and I love him unconditionally.

324
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:38,332
I always have,
and I always will.

325
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:42,832
Irrespective of what you
might see or think you see,

326
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,499
I know that he
loves me and Albert

327
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,375
more than anything else
in the world.

328
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,832
I know he doesn't always
do the right thing...

329
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,417
and that's what you see or...

330
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,750
perhaps that's... perhaps
that's what you want to see.

331
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:00,958
But I know Vic, Norm.

332
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,292
I know Vic Hill
that no one else knows.

333
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,292
And that is the man I love.

334
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:17,500
So what now, Vic?

335
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,208
A kneecapping
or the Spanish Donkey?

336
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,542
Here, I don't know who you are.

337
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:27,332
But your methods
of information extraction

338
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,125
are nothing in comparison
to when...

339
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:33,666
as a young lance corporal
in the Middle East,

340
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:36,999
I spent an uncomfortable week
as a guest...

341
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,875
I don't have time for wartime
reminiscences, old man.

342
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:44,792
I'm Vic Hill.
I'm sure you've heard of me.

343
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,583
Who?

344
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:49,417
Vic Hill?

345
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:53,000
Yes... Vic Hill.

346
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:58,583
No, doesn't ring a bell.

347
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:01,708
Tell me where the boy is at,
or the joke is over.

348
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,750
Capisce?

349
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:07,375
Mr. Hill, I was brought
into this world

350
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,292
without a home and without kin.

351
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,333
After all manner
of foster homes...

352
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,333
a stint in Borstal and a stretch
with the armed services.

353
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:18,917
The Cavendish-Scotts,
this, unique family

354
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:22,000
became my adopted family.
Vic, if you don't iron him out,

355
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:24,208
I will!

356
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,000
Be careful, you bloody
philistines!

357
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,000
Aha, ha ha.

358
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,750
Fink.

359
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,708
Sir?

360
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,875
Sit down.

361
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:58,625
What happened to you?

362
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,499
Jurisdictional
disagreement, sir.

363
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,000
Dwyer?

364
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,417
I'm sorry, Fink.

365
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:11,542
This is...

366
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,500
well, it's partly my fault.

367
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,583
Dwyer was complaining.

368
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,167
Other officers muscling in,
chasing leads

369
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,208
above their station.

370
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,332
I told her to handle it.

371
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,333
Sir, I...

372
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,833
You don't have to explain.

373
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,667
I respect a man with ambition.

374
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:33,832
We've all had to go a little...
off-piste at times

375
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,125
to get a leg up in our careers.

376
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,625
I wouldn't trust a man
who hadn't.

377
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,500
How can I help, sir?

378
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,208
The Flying Squad...

379
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,167
is no cleaner now
than in the bad old days.

380
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:54,917
A bunch of venal little bullies,

381
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,750
promoted above their station,
and for what?

382
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,833
Because they're better with
their fists than their brains.

383
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:04,708
No, no. We need an overhaul.

384
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,875
Root and branch.

385
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,583
New leadership.

386
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,042
These leads of yours,

387
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,458
I don't need details,

388
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,958
just...

389
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,042
if they're admissible.

390
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,666
In this case...

391
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,583
it's career-defining.

392
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:30,542
If I have anything
that could be of use...

393
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,708
you'll be the first
to know, sir.

394
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:45,333
There is a better version
of us all out there, Fink.

395
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:50,000
We just have to want to succeed.

396
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,833
This is some
Prince Charles shit right here!

397
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:06,750
I should run for King!

398
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,292
Nas, we gotta go.

399
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:11,250
Bag this shit up, Jimmy.

400
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:13,667
Bucket list complete!

401
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,083
Finally.

402
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,458
Now... where's my gold?

403
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,958
A gypsy camp.

404
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,792
A what?

405
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,832
The best.

406
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,666
Not this time. I said the best.

407
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:34,792
I want Windrush.

408
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,332
I already tell you.

409
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,499
Windrush is not here.

410
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,167
And I don't believe you.

411
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:42,667
Now, I have the folding,
and I have the need.

412
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,999
This ain't some sink-estate
leg-breaker bollocks.

413
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,125
This is gangland history
in the making.

414
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,417
The culmination of over a decade

415
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:55,167
of bile and bitterness.

416
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:58,375
This is mythology.

417
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:03,125
And for that,
I require a legend.

418
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:07,375
So where is he...
and what's the damage?

419
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,167
You think you
come around here...

420
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:15,666
and use my boys
for this and that.

421
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:19,542
You never ask him name,
you never shake him hand.

422
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:23,500
Always you... sneering.

423
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:27,750
You... flashin' your money.

424
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,500
But you not look men.

425
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,167
You look meat!

426
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:38,583
But let me tell you
one thing 'bout Windrush.

427
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:43,542
Him not ask question,
and him not judge nothin'.

428
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:47,500
But Windrush ain't meat.

429
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:53,167
All him ask... all him expect

430
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:55,875
from any boss wanting
the kind of reputation

431
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,542
what you mention...

432
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,542
is a little respect.

433
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:14,208
Windrush is not here.

434
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:31,417
Stop!

435
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,667
Not that one, please.

436
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,500
It's the only pressing.

437
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:38,832
It's all I've got left
of my childhood.

438
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:41,375
My.

439
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,999
This is you,
your five minutes of fame.

440
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,667
Your X-Factor moment as a cadet.

441
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:50,999
Alas, "please" isn't amongst
the magic words I'm after.

442
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,332
Bastards.

443
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:56,250
I don't believe that's
the magic word, either.

444
00:26:56,292 --> 00:26:58,083
The problem with these old 78s

445
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,833
is they're made of shellac.

446
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:04,417
They shatter like glass.

447
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,917
I drove him back from
the country estate yesterday!

448
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:10,083
He was more than
a little under the influence.

449
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:13,250
Blathering on about a...
A golden bathtub!

450
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:15,332
Complete gibberish!

451
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,499
Golden bathtub?

452
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,042
No, no! And... and something
about gypsies and smelting...

453
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,875
- Gypsies?
- And a girl named Chloe!

454
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,000
Get his car keys.

455
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:27,500
Give us your car keys.

456
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:29,125
Give us your car keys.

457
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,125
Prick.

458
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:32,667
Right...

459
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,000
Got his car keys, Vic.
Where to now?

460
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:36,500
The Pikeys.

461
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:41,625
Pikeys. I hate Pikeys.

462
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,833
What the hell is this?

463
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,625
All part of the anglo-rural
experience, Nas.

464
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,667
How are your 5p specials
holding up?

465
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:10,166
I ain't into
getting shit on my shit.

466
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:12,792
Shall we get to the business
at hand, gentlemen?

467
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,917
Who're these bastards then?

468
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,875
This is Nas Stone, Uncle Dean.

469
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:37,333
And what is a Nas Stone then?

470
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:40,832
I'm a Nas Stone.

471
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,167
What the hell are you?

472
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:47,208
I am an Uncle Dean, pal.

473
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:50,667
Jesus, look at
the size of this one.

474
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:52,499
Aye, man, look at the trousers
hangin' off his ass.

475
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,292
Hey... anything for a favor.

476
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,750
I'd kill you for a tenner.

477
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:58,333
Nas is our buyer, Uncle Dean.

478
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:00,167
So that's not stolen then?

479
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:04,708
No, it ain't stolen!

480
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,958
Hey, get them off my ride!

481
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Rich yank fella in my camp.
Thought I'd seen it all.

482
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,875
So you'll be wanting
your gold, yank?

483
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,250
Or... do you want
to buy a caravan?

484
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:29,708
Do I look like I'm here
to buy a caravan?

485
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,625
Fresh out the oven.

486
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:41,333
Horseshoes?

487
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:43,125
Lucky horseshoes.

488
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:46,875
It's one way to try
and cancel a curse.

489
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:48,375
Hold up.

490
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:49,500
What curse?

491
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:51,125
Didn't you tell him?

492
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:54,083
This is deadlier than
a banshee's wail, this pile.

493
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,059
Killed more baddies than
Clint Eastwood, so it has.

494
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:58,792
Makes Tutankhamen
look like a fairy gobshite.

495
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,875
You'll probably be fine.

496
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,332
They're poking fun.

497
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,875
It's a cultural sign
of affection, Nas.

498
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:09,292
So you happy with the inventory?

499
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:10,500
It's all there, as promised.

500
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,458
Let's weigh the shit.

501
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,667
We got scales
in the trunk of the limo.

502
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:33,083
A sickness of the heart
that only gold can cure.

503
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,226
I thought England
was all Corgis,

504
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,417
Spice Girls, tea and crumpets.

505
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,750
This is some off-the-tour-guide
"Deliverance" shit.

506
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,167
We'll complete the transaction

507
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,434
and get you out of here
as soon as possible.

508
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,292
God damn it! God...

509
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,500
Get off my ride!

510
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:07,333
Y'all crazy!

511
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:10,208
Off-the-charts, God damn
fuckin' crazy!

512
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:26,333
Eeeny, meanie...

513
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:29,708
miney...

514
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:32,833
mo.

515
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:49,917
Whoa...

516
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,333
Aah!

517
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:56,333
Shit.

518
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,542
What was that?

519
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,542
Where's the gold?

520
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,625
It's in the wheelbarrow.

521
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:13,167
Fink.

522
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:19,333
Sh...

523
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:26,666
Who's this son of a bitch?!

524
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:29,792
Sure looks like a bastard
copper to me!

525
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:30,833
Aaah!

526
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,292
Aaaaah!

527
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,667
Aah!!

528
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:18,792
Tall Paul! Tall Paul!

529
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:23,917
Agh!

530
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,499
I ain't going out like this.

531
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,000
Not here... now now!

532
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:38,625
You know who I am?

533
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,333
I designed
the diamond Brooklyn B!

534
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,333
The triple-weave gold dog rope!

535
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,833
I got my shit
placed at Tiffany's!

536
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,250
I got more followers on Insta...

537
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:54,125
than all you joke shop
sons of bitches.

538
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,292
I am Nas Stone!

539
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,875
Jeweler to the stars!

540
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:01,167
And I was born...

541
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:02,458
Shut your mother...

542
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,958
a motherfuckin'...

543
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,542
Grenade! Hey, black man!

544
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,583
Splash!

545
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,667
Sure you can't kill me!
I'm Un...

546
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:25,167
Jeez!

547
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,292
Give the the Hill kid a sendoff.

548
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:47,083
Didn't your mummy tell you
not to play with guns?

549
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,500
Right.
Let's go and get our gold.

550
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:03,125
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no...

551
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:33,167
Albert?

552
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:35,499
Albert!

553
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,999
What happened?
What happened here?!

554
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,875
What do you mean,
what happened here?

555
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:43,375
Look around you.
Everyone's dead.

556
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,167
Dead!

557
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,875
Where's my gold, boy?

558
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,000
Where's my gold?!

559
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:54,667
I lost it.

560
00:35:56,417 --> 00:35:57,792
Me.

561
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:00,875
Bob Fink's got it.

562
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,625
All of it.

563
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,583
Okay, Charlie.

564
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:16,333
All or nothing.

565
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,833
Come on!

566
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:37,458
Fuck!

567
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:30,292
I'm baaack, Charlie boy!

568
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,792
What...

569
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,583
Yes.

570
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,708
Yeees!

571
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:27,208
Yeeees! Yeees!

572
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:51,500
Windrush.

573
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,667
Respect.

574
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,833
Best man gets the spoils.

575
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:18,833
I can't pretend to be
disappointed, Detective.

576
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,500
That would imply, after all,

577
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,625
an expectation of character.

578
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,667
Sir.

579
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,542
Windrush...

580
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:33,875
Boss.

581
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,333
So he's what?

582
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,833
Undercover?

583
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,542
Windrush is one of yours?

584
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,667
Don't be silly, Bob.

585
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,833
Private hire.

586
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,708
Been on the books for years.

587
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,333
Very valuable asset.

588
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,750
I take it you're here
to arrest me.

589
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:06,958
You were supposed
to have been killed

590
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,500
in Vic Hill's lockup
15 years ago.

591
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:13,875
Often how these
big cases go, Bob.

592
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:16,667
Sometimes you just keep
plotting away

593
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:19,542
and get there in the end.

594
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:26,042
You were in on that?

595
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,375
Like I said...

596
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:30,666
we all have to go
a little off-piste at times

597
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,750
to get a leg up.

598
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,125
Perhaps if you'd focused on

599
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:45,667
one thing or another,

600
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,833
you might have made
something out of your life.

601
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:53,250
But all these grudges, these...

602
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:54,958
seedy little agendas.

603
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:10,333
Yeah.

604
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,875
Well.
