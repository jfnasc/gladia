1
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:06,999
Have you considered
just once that Dad

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,124
is not the bloke
you think he is?

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,332
He's a selfish prick.

4
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:10,541
They wanted us
out of the picture.

5
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:11,624
Who wanted us out
of the picture?

6
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:12,708
Albert, Lily.

7
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,832
- Where's the gold?!
- It's in the wheelbarrow.

8
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,249
Where's my gold, boy?

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,417
Bob Fink's got it.

10
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:22,791
Okay, Charlie.

11
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:24,374
I want to see her.

12
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,666
They were supposed to kill you

13
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:28,957
in Vic Hill's lockup
15 years ago.

14
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,541
You were in on that?

15
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:33,292
We all have to go a little
off peace at times.

16
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,749
Yes, sir.

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,750
The truck is on its way.

18
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,457
Hello, hello,
my little Grim Reaper.

19
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,207
You still trucking, baby?

20
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:56,166
<i>How long until
your heavy-metal steed</i>

21
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:57,999
<i>slams into my throbbing
mosh pit?</i>

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,917
Should be clocked out by 2:00.

23
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,625
Right, let's be having ya.

24
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,042
No, you bloody well don't.

25
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:23,417
We've rung the bell.

26
00:01:57,042 --> 00:02:00,208
I warned you, Bobby-Boy.
Now look at ya.

27
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,583
Right ol' mess.

28
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,249
Right, we got 30 hours
to the exchange.

29
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,332
Got a safe house
on Rivington Street

30
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,832
where we can stash it.

31
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,166
No.

32
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,666
Take it to Elm Lodge.

33
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,166
Bit close to home, sir.

34
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:18,832
I don't intend to let this
out of my sight, Dwyer.

35
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,499
Call Peters.

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,749
Have him meet us there
with the rest of the squad.

37
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,082
Load the gold into the van.

38
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:29,250
And if you ask Windrush nicely,
he might lend a hand.

39
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,333
Well?

40
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:55,000
Keys, keys, keys, keys, keys.

41
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,375
God.

42
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,874
Come on, let's go.
Come on, come on, boy.

43
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,000
Come on. Good boy.

44
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:07,707
Vic.

45
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,249
Albert.

46
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,000
Lotti.

47
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:13,122
What the hell's going on?

48
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:16,332
Vic?
Family meeting, everyone out.

49
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,832
- Stay.
- Get out!

50
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,166
Stay! They've been more family

51
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:20,957
than you have
these past few years.

52
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,832
All right, I'll tell you
what happened.

53
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:26,582
Your son lost my gold
to Bob Fink, all of it!

54
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,916
Your gold?

55
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:29,166
You had it for all of
about an hour

56
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:31,249
15 years ago
the night you lost it.

57
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,791
- I was sold out.
- Yeah, by Bob Fink.

58
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,332
How did we not see
that one coming?

59
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,666
That was then and this is now,
and now it's you!

60
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,207
You're the snake
in the grass, my own son.

61
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:42,041
You lied to me! Both of ya!

62
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,374
Your father and your husband.

63
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,332
Father, that's debatable,
isn't it?

64
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,457
I try my best for you, boy.

65
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,499
Being a bank robber
and a responsible parent

66
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,166
weren't exactly
compatible occupations.

67
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,916
Who said you had to be
a bank robber?

68
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:55,499
I wouldn't have cared if you
were a plumber or a pen pusher.

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,374
I was not meant to stick
my head under a sink

70
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,374
or rot behind a desk!

71
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,999
And neither were you.
That is not the Hill way.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,582
Hill way? Do me a favor.

73
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,916
We have been hanging on
by a thread

74
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:08,999
as long as I can remember!

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,999
That is enough, the pair of you!

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,124
You are so blind.

77
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,416
So desperate to dish out
the blame.

78
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,374
You are both
as obsessed as each other,

79
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,375
two peas from the same pod.

80
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:27,374
Now, this bloody gold has taken

81
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,542
its pound of flesh
from all of us.

82
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,500
It's all of us, not just you.

83
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,249
I'm glad it's gone.
Fink's welcome to it.

84
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,832
It can bury him the same way
it's buried

85
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,292
everybody else
who's had it in their hands.

86
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,457
It's late. We're all exhausted.

87
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,583
Get some sleep.

88
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,958
Everybody stays here tonight.

89
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:12,667
What do you want, Vic?

90
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,083
My wife.

91
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,957
Fifteen years a long time
for a stag

92
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,874
to be estranged from his doe.

93
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,707
The only loving embrace
you're gonna get tonight

94
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,999
is from the cushion of the sofa.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,875
Well, I didn't mean it
like that, Lil.

96
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,458
I just... wanted to talk.

97
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,082
- Well?
- Would you have preferred it

98
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,791
if I was a civilian, Lil,

99
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:42,457
stuck behind a desk every day?

100
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,457
Me wearing a tie.

101
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,332
You packing me cheese
and chutney sandwiches

102
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,499
every day for lunch,
would that have made you happy?

103
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,499
I knew who you were
when we tied the knot

104
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,499
and I signed up to it,
all of it.

105
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
And God knows
I've always fancied you.

106
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,916
Sometimes I wish I didn't.

107
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:02,333
Would've made all these
past years a lot more bearable.

108
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:07,167
It's not me that you need
to worry about, it's your son.

109
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,666
He needs a father who loves him,

110
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:14,249
who, more importantly,
trusts him.

111
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,250
You know, he's grown up into
a smart young man, your Albert.

112
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,833
I just hope you take the time
to get to know him.

113
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,666
You used to be a bit of
a footballer back in the day.

114
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,166
- You still play a bit?
- Why?

115
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:38,916
You fancy a kick about,
Hate 'Em?

116
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,541
You know, your old man used
to drive me mad in the nick.

117
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:44,291
Spun me the same story
over and over again

118
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:46,166
about how you scored
the winning goal

119
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,374
on some poxy
little league cup final.

120
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,166
I'm surprised he even
remembered that.

121
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:52,167
I never heard the end of it.

122
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:56,291
The score was 1-1.

123
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,166
It was the 89th minute.

124
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:00,666
My Albert through on goal.

125
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:03,124
Legs pumping like a pair
of pistons.

126
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,624
Two massive defenders

127
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,999
descending down on him
from either side.

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,666
He drops his shoulder.

129
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,791
Shells the first one like
a monkey nut.

130
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:13,082
Second one got twisted
like a pretzel.

131
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,082
Then it was my boy.

132
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,832
One on one with the keeper.

133
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,082
The keeper's come out,
spread himself like an octopus,

134
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,082
all arms and legs.

135
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,916
My Albert stood his ground.

136
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:24,832
Spun that kid like a tornado.

137
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,624
Smashed the back of that net.

138
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,875
Yes, get in there!

139
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,042
You know, I thought
I was gonna miss that?

140
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,457
Your dad didn't.

141
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,832
He always knew
you was gonna score.

142
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,375
Never doubted you for a minute.

143
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,374
Anyway, look, I'm knackered.

144
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,542
I'm gonna go
and get my head down.

145
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,875
Good night, kid.

146
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,042
Back of the net.

147
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,833
Scoot.

148
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,332
Wake me up in five.

149
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,333
I need to go and find the guys.

150
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,750
Charlie!

151
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:00,332
- Charlie.
- Morning.

152
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,667
Morning. Come in.
The gang's in there.

153
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,499
Come here.

154
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,666
Where have you been?

155
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,999
Let me see.

156
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,332
I was kidnapped.

157
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,749
Handcuffed to a radiator.

158
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,457
Beaten to a pulp,
stuck in a closet,

159
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,041
then witness to a brutal murder.

160
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,457
You, been hitting

161
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,874
the old gin and mushrooms
again, mate?

162
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,999
Those days are behind me,
Billy-Boy.

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,416
I'm a new man.

164
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:23,666
- Who's this?
- This is Scooter.

165
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:27,082
I adopted him.

166
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,666
God, what happened? Someone die?

167
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,500
Yeah, actually,
quite a few people.

168
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,667
We lost the gold, Charlie.

169
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,791
Fink's got it. We're done.

170
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,749
Yeah, well, actually,
Fink doesn't have it.

171
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,999
He's dead.

172
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,624
What do you mean... Fink's dead?

173
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,249
Yeah, with Fink's brains
splattered across the rug,

174
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,374
off skipped
Chief Superintendent Jones

175
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,332
to Elm Lodge with our bounty.

176
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,624
Do you know this Jones
character, Hate 'Em?

177
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,874
Yeah, he was a bent copper

178
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,957
on the beat
from back in the day.

179
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,832
Must have bullied his way
up the ladder.

180
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,666
And he said 30 hours
to this exchange, right?

181
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:05,166
So he's gonna off-load the gold

182
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,999
early tomorrow morning
to his client.

183
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,457
So that gives us enough time
to track him down, right?

184
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,624
We are not going through
all this again.

185
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:16,249
We are not going after the gold.

186
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,666
Now, I said it would kill Fink

187
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,082
just like it's killed
everybody else.

188
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,541
What more proof do you need?

189
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,082
Yeah, I'm with Mum on this one.
Forget the gold.

190
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,332
Let somebody else feel
the weight of it.

191
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,832
We hit Jones
at this exchange instead.

192
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,042
Let him do the work for us.
We go for money.

193
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,666
I like where you're going
with this, son.

194
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,249
We cut the middleman,
play the end game.

195
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,166
What do you reckon, Lil?

196
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:39,166
Decamp to the lockup?

197
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:42,832
Plan it out properly,
just like old times?

198
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,166
We pull this off, Mum,
and we're clear

199
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,291
of all this shit.

200
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,666
We make for the sun
like you and Dad always wanted.

201
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,292
A new life away from all this.

202
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,542
- Dad, you all right?
- Vic?

203
00:13:58,542 --> 00:13:59,666
Vic?

204
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,166
<i>Don't shoot!</i>

205
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,374
<i>Dirty son of a bitch!</i>

206
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,832
Vic?

207
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,666
Yeah, I'm all right.

208
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,457
Time to lay
these ghosts to rest.

209
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,083
Yeah.

210
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,666
Girls?

211
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:27,875
Follow me.

212
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,833
All right, Vic,
where's the work tools?

213
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,667
Ma'am.

214
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,333
Do the honors, Hate 'Em.

215
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,417
Be rude not to, Vic.

216
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,250
Albert?

217
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,457
Jesus, Dad,
I thought you was a bank robber,

218
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,832
not an urban guerrilla.

219
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,999
You know
I've always been a sucker

220
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,499
for big-boys' toys, Albert.

221
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,708
Hot potato!

222
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:53,416
"Elm Lodge residence,
Chief Superintendent Jones."

223
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:55,541
What you got?

224
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:57,582
Maps. Aerial shots.

225
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,582
Even some interior photos.

226
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,582
We need plans
of the internal layout.

227
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,832
Building specs.

228
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,499
Looks like a modern house,

229
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,291
so, architectural records
should be available, right?

230
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:09,458
Let's find out.

231
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:31,167
- You all right under there?
- Yeah.

232
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,082
Here we go.

233
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,499
Got it?

234
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,917
- You got it?
- Yeah.

235
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,249
Jesus.

236
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,166
Now that is
some old-school shit.

237
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,541
There is no school like
the old school, son.

238
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:46,874
Ain't that the truth.

239
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,499
Can someone let me out now,
please?

240
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,167
Coming on out you come. Coming.

241
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,625
Ooh.

242
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,916
You all right?

243
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:58,625
I ain't got time to bleed,
Hate 'em?

244
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,708
Hello, old girl. Been a while.

245
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,624
Jesus, shouldn't that thing
be in a museum?

246
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,707
This thing's Old Gerty, son.

247
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,332
Don't be fooled by her oil leaks
and rusty drawers.

248
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,667
This darling has tapped
more conflabs than MI5.

249
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,499
It's dead as a doornail, Vic.

250
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,916
Lift her up, Norm.

251
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,250
Let's have a look.

252
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:35,833
I'll get this old bird
singing in no time.

253
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:39,999
That's everything we got
on Elm Lodge.

254
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,999
Blimey.
Honks a bit in here, Mr. Hill.

255
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,457
Yeah, well, you'd be a bit musty

256
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,207
if you've been banged up
for 15 years, Charlie.

257
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,541
You think these Young Turks
are taking the mickey out of us?

258
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,416
Would you like me to put them
in the Judas cradle, Victor?

259
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:53,582
No, no, no, today we're all
love and light, Hate 'Em.

260
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,124
No negative vibes?

261
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,792
Right you are. Okay.

262
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,291
Good old days, Lil?

263
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:02,833
Less of the old.

264
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,708
Name that heist.

265
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,332
Bradox job, '88.

266
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,332
Electronic goods warehouse.

267
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,666
Down payment on our first flat.

268
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:21,332
Yeah, carried you
over the threshold.

269
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,832
Didn't put me down for a week.

270
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,791
Wait.

271
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:28,791
I still fancy you, sweetheart.

272
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,791
More than ever.

273
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:32,167
I know you do.

274
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,332
Ho-ho!

275
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,917
Thar she blows, Starbuck.

276
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,000
Go on, turn it in.

277
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,666
You're looking good, Charlie.

278
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,707
Do I?

279
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:58,332
Yeah, well, I... yeah.
Well, yes, I do.

280
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,624
You know what?
I feel good, Chloe.

281
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,958
Yeah.

282
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,083
What we up against?

283
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,374
How does all this work,
then, Norman?

284
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,042
Nothing to it, son.

285
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,957
<i>If that mutt goes anywhere
near my bacon sandwich,</i>

286
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,958
I'll turn it into mufflers.

287
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,707
What do you reckon, Dad?

288
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,499
I reckon we lay bugs...

289
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,916
here... here...

290
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,499
and here.

291
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,999
Give ourselves good coverage
to pick up Jones's comms

292
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,999
on the time and place
of the gold exchange.

293
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,499
Right. Picture time.

294
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,666
We're gonna need passports.

295
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:44,916
What look are we going
for, Mrs. H?

296
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,457
Straight goer, Hate 'Em.

297
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,916
Just keep your mouth shut
and you'll be fine.

298
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:50,250
There you go. Just look straight
at the camera.

299
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,041
Got it? Lovely.

300
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:55,375
Next? Who's up next? Come on.

301
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,832
- Go on, you get up.
- Yeah.

302
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,333
Fine work here.

303
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,207
Albert, do the honors.

304
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,292
- Me?
- It's your plan, son.

305
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:37,832
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, and Hate 'Em...

306
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,707
I hope you're ready
for the main event.

307
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,249
We got three phases.

308
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,749
Phase one is intel,
phase two is the takedown,

309
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,917
phase three is the getaway.

310
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,582
Have a look around ya.

311
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,999
Look at each other.

312
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,874
Each and every one of you
has a skill set

313
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,707
that is going to come in handy.

314
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,791
Now, whatever role you play,

315
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,166
we're all as equally
as important

316
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:05,499
if we're gonna pull this off.

317
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,333
We work together.
We work as a team, all of us.

318
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,125
We work as a family.

319
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,582
You'll set the pineapples off!

320
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,917
Let's go to work.

321
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:07,207
Vic?

322
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,416
Albert?

323
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:10,207
- Albert?
- What?

324
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,541
I'm not sure how I feel about
being called a "tit," mate.

325
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:16,582
Who was the one that wanted
a bird as a code name?

326
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,499
You. All right?

327
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,374
Now go on.
Get up in the nest, Blue Tit.

328
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,999
Sort it out, Norman.

329
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,625
Horrible you are. Horrible kid.

330
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,499
What?

331
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,583
You pulled the short straw.

332
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,333
Don't get too comfy, boys.

333
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,583
This lot attracts bad guys
like flies to shit.

334
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:53,374
Look at you two,
Ronnie and Reggie.

335
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,874
Yeah, which one am I?

336
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,332
Ronnie or Reggie?

337
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:01,249
You're Ronnie, of course,
Charlie.

338
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,042
Here you go, boys. Get mic'd up.

339
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,541
And you cannot break into
a house

340
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:09,667
without these bad boys.

341
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,333
There you go.

342
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:23,208
Um, yeah, what exactly are
these, Mr. Hill?

343
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,333
- They're creepers.
- They're creepers.

344
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,833
Bill, get Hate 'Em up
on comms, will ya?

345
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,416
Blue Tit, this is Night Thunder.

346
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:37,416
And copy? Over.

347
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,332
<i>- Night Thunder?
- Night Thunder?</i>

348
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,374
Are you taking the piss?

349
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,542
Well, that's rich coming
from a blue tit. Over.

350
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,832
<i>Blue Tit, this is Butch Cassidy.</i>

351
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,666
Yeah, course it fuckin' is.

352
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:55,332
<i>Are you in the nest? Over.</i>

353
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,957
Give me a minute, will you...

354
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,292
Butch?

355
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,874
How much longer are these
bloody Corsicans

356
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,499
gonna keep me waiting
on this exchange point?

357
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,125
They're most likely navigating
their way into the docks... sir.

358
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,083
The question is,
which docks, Dwyer?

359
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:31,833
And is this
to your liking... sir?

360
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:35,750
Yes.

361
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:44,000
Thank you, Dwyer.

362
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:51,499
Into position then, lads.
Keep 'em peeled.

363
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,542
Roger that, Sundance.

364
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:07,457
Here'll be fine.
Here'll be fine.

365
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:11,332
Blue Tit is in the nest.

366
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:14,832
What's the scores on the doors,
Blue Tit? Over.

367
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:17,666
You got two of them snot rags
trooping the front.

368
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,166
You got two around the back.

369
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:21,457
And they're tooled up
to the max.

370
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,458
Over.

371
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:24,082
Copy that, Blue Tit.

372
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,374
You're up, Thunder.

373
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:27,417
Let's do this.

374
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:51,333
Ronnie and Reggie, in position.

375
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:02,500
Go, Reggie, go!

376
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:11,999
What's going on, boys?

377
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,208
Nothin', boss.
Motorbike a backfire.

378
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:23,500
Right, stand down. As you were.

379
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,332
<i>Ronnie and Reggie
are in the house.</i>

380
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,093
Well done, now in and out,
fast as you can.

381
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:52,291
<i>Live on one.</i>

382
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:55,124
They're heading back inside.

383
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,332
Snot rags coming back
into the gaff.

384
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:57,582
Take cover, boys.

385
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:58,874
What's going on out there?

386
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:00,124
Nothing to worry about,

387
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,958
just a motorbike backfiring,
sir.

388
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:05,749
Brass monkeys out.
Do you fancy a brew?

389
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,333
Yeah, milk and two,
stirred to the right.

390
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,167
I'll stir you to the right,
you twat.

391
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:31,792
Nouveau riche wanker.

392
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,958
Ta.

393
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,333
Ronnie!

394
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,458
You are going down, Johnson.

395
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,166
Are they in?

396
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:37,500
They're creepin'.

397
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:46,125
Creepers.

398
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,916
Ooh-hoo!
I just nearly got it in.

399
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:59,208
Right, mate, seen ya.

400
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,499
We're live on two.

401
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,250
<i>You're punching above
your weight, Peters.</i>

402
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,333
<i>All right, come on.</i>

403
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:24,667
Bad guys... they're everywhere.

404
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,957
Sir.

405
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:31,667
Well, this bad guy needs
a refill.

406
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:49,457
Butch... I've got eyeballs on...

407
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:53,000
one of the twins in the TV room.

408
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,666
It's Ronnie.

409
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:59,374
He's got some balls, that boy,
hasn't he?

410
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:01,833
Here you are, sir.

411
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:14,832
We've got a full house, boys.

412
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:17,375
Edward G. Robinson's
a real man, sir.

413
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,874
False alarm, boys.

414
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,625
Reggie and Ronnie,
get back to base.

415
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:48,207
Rack 'em up.

416
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,499
<i>Double or quits here.
All right, stop whining.</i>

417
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,020
You rack 'em up,
I'm gonna grab a beer.

418
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:01,249
<i>You're a very bad boy, sir.</i>

419
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,082
Is that all you've got, Dwyer?

420
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,250
<i>Put your back into it,
for Christ's sake.</i>

421
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,583
I'll shit you, Johnson.

422
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,500
Prosecco? What a tosser.

423
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:25,833
Knob head's got to have
a beer somewhere.

424
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:39,125
Unh!

425
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:02,374
<i>Ronnie and Reggie,
what is your status?</i>

426
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:05,166
Ronnie had to nobble
one of the Heavy Mob, Butch.

427
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:07,707
Now we're stuck in that larder.

428
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,874
Well, get out of there,
sharpish.

429
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,542
I'm workin' on it, Sundance.

430
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:18,582
Come in, Butch Cassidy.
This is Blue Tit.

431
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:21,207
<i>I am bored out of my nut.</i>

432
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:24,791
Can I please
just shoot somebody now, over?

433
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,791
No, you bloody well can't,
Blue Tit.

434
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:28,792
Hold your position.

435
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,083
Listen up, boys.

436
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:37,124
Jones. No, I thought

437
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,332
I was quite clear on this, dear.

438
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,833
You're not to call
on my work line.

439
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,041
Dinner?

440
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:44,499
It's quite impossible, Patricia.

441
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,832
I'm staying at
the country house tonight.

442
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,332
Your parents are coming...

443
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,832
Sounds like trouble
back at the ranch.

444
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:52,332
Not feeling sorry
for him, are you, Dad?

445
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:56,291
Sympathy and empathy
are worlds apart, Albert.

446
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:58,791
<i>Supercedes official
police business.</i>

447
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:00,249
Quite honestly,
you can feed them all

448
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,166
dog food for all I care.

449
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:03,792
Good night.

450
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,875
That's the spirit, sir.

451
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:15,207
Do you know, given the choice...

452
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,874
I think...

453
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,541
yeah, I-I think
I'd rather be Reggie.

454
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:21,166
Shh.

455
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,666
What are you talking about, son?

456
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,832
Ronnie and Reggie Kray?

457
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:27,207
Reggie was always
the cool one, wasn't her?

458
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:28,499
Well, having worked
with 'em both,

459
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,707
I don't recall either of them

460
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,167
being particularly cool,
Charlie.

461
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:37,332
You know,
if we ever do this again.

462
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,166
I'd like to be Reggie next time.

463
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:41,999
Whatever floats your boat, son.

464
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,957
Butch Cassidy, there's no way
of getting out of here

465
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,374
without kicking the door down.

466
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,457
- Shit.
- Ooh.

467
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,166
That is a negative, Reggie.

468
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:50,416
You hold tight
until we get the intel,

469
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:52,957
and then we will slip in
and, liberate ya.

470
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,582
- Roger that.
- What are you talking about?

471
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:55,957
We can't just
leave 'em in in there.

472
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:58,207
They're big boys.
They're tucked away.

473
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:00,207
If we charge in there now,
we will blow it.

474
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:01,666
No, we wait
until we get the intel

475
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:02,999
and the Heavy Mob leave.

476
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,666
If they are compromised,

477
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,042
we bust in there
all guns blazing.

478
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:12,624
Listen, Albert...

479
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,874
I lost it all before,

480
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:17,332
and I'm not talking
about the gold.

481
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,332
I will not take a chance

482
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,791
if it means losing it all again.

483
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:26,166
This, here, now,
is my dream come true.

484
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:29,125
Me and my boy... together.

485
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,416
Jesus Christ.

486
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:33,916
You make it sound
like we're camping.

487
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:36,041
I know. Never been happier.

488
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:38,125
Or prouder.

489
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,749
Never saw myself as taking
a back seat to a fella.

490
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,832
Sweetheart, if our boys
do get the money,

491
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:48,999
who do you think has to get
the plan in place to disappear?

492
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,708
You really want to leave that
up to them?

493
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:55,625
They are relying upon us
for the long game.

494
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:59,499
Being the better half
to a bank robber

495
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,791
requires a certain... gift.

496
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:04,999
A certain spirit.

497
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,457
You wait in the wings,
often for years,

498
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:08,624
but when you're called upon

499
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:10,832
you act with a cool head...

500
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,500
and a clear conscience.

501
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,416
Are we thinking
the Costa del Sol, Lily?

502
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:19,541
No. Not the Costa.

503
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:21,832
Too many old acquaintances
and bad beer.

504
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:25,167
Somewhere more inland.
A lovely finca.

505
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,832
Do you know, I've always
wanted to grow oranges?

506
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,667
Got it.

507
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:39,207
Jones here.

508
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:41,583
About time, Petru.

509
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:44,499
We're on.

510
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,332
<i>Choppy waters out of Ajaccio.</i>

511
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,624
<i>Yes, of course
we have the shipment.</i>

512
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:51,750
<i>We're just waiting on
the exchange point.</i>

513
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,708
Liverpool docks? Really?

514
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:58,249
Ready?

515
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,833
<i>That's quite some distance
from here.</i>

516
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,222
<i>After the morning tide.
No, wait, I need...</i>

517
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,333
<i>- Come on, come on.
- Pier number...</i>

518
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,666
Dock number...

519
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:22,916
Shit.

520
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:25,791
<i>No, no, you listen to me.</i>

521
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:28,832
There'll be
no more mistakes, Petru.

522
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,667
We're on our way.

523
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:34,416
We're on, Dwyer.

524
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:36,166
<i>Get the boys
to load up the gold.</i>

525
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:37,749
Liverpool docks.

526
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,874
Coming in from Ajaccio before
the morning tide.

527
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:41,457
Yeah, yeah, but that
narrows it down, though, right?

528
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,082
Yeah, enough to follow
the scent, boys.

529
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,999
Ronnie and Reggie,
stay in position.

530
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,332
The eagle has landed,
the Heavy Mob are on the move.

531
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,166
Blue Tit, what's the SP?

532
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:51,499
Butch, they're on the move.

533
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,707
Start 'er up, Benny-Boy.

534
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:54,833
Okay.

535
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,667
It won't start!

536
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:10,750
Is that a Wood Lark?

537
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:20,792
Shit, shit!

538
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,875
Johnson!
We're movin' out, ya bellend.

539
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:18,332
Butch... send in the cavalry.

540
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:19,957
I'm going in.

541
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:22,499
We are not going in now
with our dicks in our hands.

542
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,333
It's time...
for the big boys' toys.

543
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:33,333
Let's go.

544
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:54,708
Fuck.

545
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:17,250
No! No...

546
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,458
Shit!

547
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:43,208
It was him or me, son.

548
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:09,750
Get the gold in the van! Now!

549
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:16,333
Sir! Sir!

550
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:22,387
Get the van, meet us around
the front. Go!

551
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:28,042
Come on!

552
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,416
It's no good, Vic.

553
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:45,207
My guts are fallin' out.
Up you go, old man.

554
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,292
I've got you. Come on, Norm.

555
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:52,707
Vic...

556
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,291
take Lily to the sun.

557
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:56,499
Make her happy.

558
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,875
I will, old friend. I promise.

559
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,625
Go, Vic, go!

560
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,292
Come on, sir, quick.

561
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:17,125
Move out, move out!

562
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:22,500
We're moving out!

563
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,541
Billy!
Give me the bike keys, now!

564
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:46,542
Come on, son, quick!

565
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:49,166
Charlie, take this.

566
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,666
Where's my dad?

567
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:52,832
He's in the back of Jones's van.

568
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:55,833
Let's get going, come on.
Now, now, now!

569
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:13,750
Come on.

570
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:20,833
Unh!
