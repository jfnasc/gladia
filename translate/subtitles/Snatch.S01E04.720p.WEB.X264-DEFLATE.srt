1
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:08,624
What's your boy done
with my diamonds?

2
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,582
My boy wouldn't rip you off,
Saul, he knows what's what.

3
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,207
Let's just tell Saul Gold
who heisted it.

4
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,999
I want that gold, boy.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,457
And if you don't bring it to me,
I will come for it.

6
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,207
We're gonna need
a proper safecracker.

7
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,207
- Norman Gordon!
- I have an expertise

8
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,541
that nobody seems to have
the patience for.

9
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:24,749
You crack on, Norman,
I'll be back in a minute.

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,332
Nobody turns over
Sonny Castillo!

11
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,582
We need to find a way
to move some of this gold

12
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,332
to pay off Saul.
I can fence your gold.

13
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,207
How does she know
about the gold?

14
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,958
Someone had to take action.
Just hear her out about it.

15
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:42,166
- Yep.
- We're on for tonight.

16
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,250
Nice.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,458
Lads... we're on.

18
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,333
Open it!

19
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,208
Open it!

20
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:23,958
Open it!

21
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,333
And the cage!

22
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,375
Get down!

23
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,958
Bob? You dirty son of a bitch.

24
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:29,332
Give me a minute with him, okay?

25
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,583
- Two minutes, all right.
- Good man.

26
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:38,999
You sneaky bastard.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,957
You were supposed to tip us off
about the bullion,

28
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,499
not turn us in!

29
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,166
Where was my cut
on the Fanon heist?

30
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,791
I gave you your bloody cut!

31
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:51,499
Five percent?
You treated me like a lackey

32
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,541
when I gift-wrapped that one
for you, Vic.

33
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:58,499
You know, all I wanted
was just to be appreciated.

34
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,082
You know, just to be
one of the boys,

35
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,832
get an invite to a Sunday roast.

36
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,541
Your feelings hurt?

37
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:06,666
Did we disrespect
your enormous talent

38
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,541
for bribing bank tellers?

39
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:11,166
Let's not dwell on the past,
Vic, let's focus on the present.

40
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:15,166
You are looking at a very long
stretch away from your family.

41
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:18,874
Now, I could help make things
a lot easier for them.

42
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:22,791
The gold is gone.
Bent coppers with big ideas.

43
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:25,667
We both got our pants
pulled down.

44
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,207
You put the word on the street,
help me find the gold,

45
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,042
and I'll make sure Lily
and Albert don't want for much.

46
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:47,749
I'll shoot your bloody
kneecaps off!

47
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,208
I'll take that as a no then.

48
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Enjoy the next 15 to life, mate.
I know I will.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,874
Take him back to the station
and charge him.

50
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,875
Aye-aye, boss.

51
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,332
Vic Hill... big man.

52
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,792
Phone call. I get a phone call.

53
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:21,250
One.

54
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,499
Hi, darling, it's me.

55
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,332
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm all right, I'm all right.

56
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,292
You listen very closely,
sweetheart.

57
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:50,332
Well... it all went
according to plan...

58
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,750
till it didn't.

59
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,957
You know there's not
a fence in town

60
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,499
willing to take on
that kind of heat.

61
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,041
Who said anything
about staying local?

62
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:31,499
Your passports up to date?

63
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,332
- Passports?
- Where are we going?

64
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,166
- New York.
- New York?

65
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,916
- New York now!
- You guys heard of Nas Stone?

66
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:38,999
He's that baller jeweler, right?

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,791
Correct!

68
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:42,166
So, what are we
doing here, player?

69
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:43,874
But not just any baller jeweler.

70
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,207
Time piece?

71
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,624
Nas Stone is
the Brooklyn Bling King.

72
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,166
I got it, son.

73
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,791
New York's jeweler to the stars.

74
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:52,416
We going full grill!
You gotta make a splash.

75
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:54,874
See that shit a mile away.
Three diamonds... a ruby...

76
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,582
a Brooklyn B...
and a motherfucking peace sign.

77
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,332
Now, normally, this shit
gonna run you half a mil,

78
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,041
but, you my boy.

79
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:01,916
We gonna do it for 450
if you blast me on repeat

80
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:04,332
on Twitter and Insta.

81
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,374
Look, no offense, right,
but I don't know you,

82
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,332
and I trust about
as far as I can throw ya,

83
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,791
and that is not across the Atlantic.
We'd be back in 24 hours,

84
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:12,791
in time for you to make good
with Saul.

85
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,749
And not wanting to put
too fine a point on it,

86
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,499
he's not gonna give you
an extension.

87
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,957
Sounds like a better idea than,
you know, waiting around here

88
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,250
to get whacked by Sonny, heh.

89
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:33,707
How much gold is this Nas Stone
fella looking to buy?

90
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,624
He said we'd start off
with 250K sterling.

91
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,541
That should take care
of your immediate problem.

92
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:41,000
And then, we'll take it from
there if both parties agree.

93
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,666
All right.

94
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,041
But Charlie and I go with ya.

95
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:53,833
Already booked the tickets.

96
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,250
You're gonna cook
like a burrito.

97
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,874
Did you find Lotti?

98
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,416
Straight-up vanished.

99
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:14,624
How about you?

100
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,917
Do you know where
my beautiful <i>chica </i>is?

101
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,333
You're not gonna live
long enough to regret that.

102
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,292
No one's coming for you,
old man.

103
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:54,916
Billy, you've gotta find a way
of getting Norman out,

104
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:56,707
'cause he ain't
gonna last long with fuckface.

105
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,666
All right, well,
I'll see a man about a dog.

106
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:02,041
Good lad.

107
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:06,166
- Lotti Mott.
- Chloe Koen.

108
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,999
I'm an equal partner.

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,457
So, get any clever ideas about
blagging my share of the gold,

110
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,042
and I'll feed you to the pigs.

111
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:17,833
Pig fodder. Got it.

112
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,499
I hate to be a downer,
but one other thing.

113
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,624
How you getting
those past customs?

114
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,750
May I make a suggestion?

115
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:53,875
Get along then.

116
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:02,625
Have one for me.

117
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,458
The sleeper, you bastard.

118
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Who are you talking to, Dad?

119
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,957
Nobody, son.

120
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,582
Dad, can we go to the funfair
this weekend with Billy?

121
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:22,749
No can do, Albert.

122
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,999
I'm a bit tied up at the moment.

123
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,832
But you said we'd go
for my ninth birthday,

124
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,208
and we never did.

125
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:35,499
Yeah. Sorry about that, mate.

126
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,333
I truly am.

127
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,833
Who are you talking to, Dad?

128
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,250
Bloody sleeper.

129
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,749
But I wanted to go
on the carousel.

130
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,207
Carousel's shite.

131
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,249
- How about crazy golf?
- That's for kids.

132
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,125
- But I am a kid, Dad.
- No, you...

133
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,542
No.

134
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,582
Nervous flyer.

135
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,875
And I haven't been on a plane
since I was a kid.

136
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,124
Beer or wine, sir?

137
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,791
Yeah, let's...
Let's do a G and T.

138
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,124
Certainly, sir.

139
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,999
Meshes better with the valium.

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,667
It's the only way to fly.

141
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:43,749
Why did you bring me
to this shithole?

142
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,207
I told ya, I'm here to see
a man about a dog.

143
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,708
A three-legged dog?

144
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,583
Billy fucking Ayres.

145
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,749
- Tall Paul.
- To what do we owe this honor?

146
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,874
I'm here for a sit-down
with Uncle Dean.

147
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:25,374
A sit-down with Uncle Dean?
Is that fucking right?

148
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,999
You shoulda let us know
you were stopping by.

149
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,707
I woulda washed me hair
for you, now.

150
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,666
And I would've rolled out
the red carpet just for you.

151
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:34,541
Piss off whilst you still got
boots to walk in, pretty boy.

152
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:37,082
Now, I didn't come here
for a tear-up.

153
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,499
If you wanna go that way,
I'll hit you so hard,

154
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,791
you'll wake up pretty.

155
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,124
Put the brakes on, boys.

156
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,499
Let's move this along, Billy.

157
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,499
Yeah, well, when you grow
a set of knackers,

158
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,999
you know where
to find me, Billy boy!

159
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Hey?!

160
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,583
Move along now with ya.

161
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,582
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
this is your captain speaking.

162
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,083
<i>We are about to make</i>
our final descent to...

163
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,332
We still here?

164
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,874
I'm just giving him
a couple minutes, all right?

165
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,832
- Pussy.
- Easy.

166
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,916
Uncle Dean? Open the door!

167
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,042
What?!

168
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:50,041
Can't even have a shite
without some bas...

169
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:51,458
Hello.

170
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:57,041
Well, hello to you.

171
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,042
You are a sweet one, darling.

172
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,957
- King Royston's boy?
- Yeah.

173
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,124
The didicoy.

174
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,332
That's right.

175
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,957
I haven't seen you
around here in a while.

176
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,457
Yeah, well...

177
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,750
didn't think I was welcome.

178
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:20,791
Where's my dog?

179
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:23,041
Dog!

180
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:25,292
Dog! Hey, dog!

181
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,083
Dog!

182
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:34,625
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
I put you off, yeah?

183
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,832
- Here you go, Uncle D.
- Thank you.

184
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,667
- Hi.
- Yourself?

185
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,500
Dog!

186
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:50,041
What do you want, son?

187
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:52,666
A good man
is about to get mullered,

188
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,082
and we need your help
to get him out.

189
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,457
Well, a lot of good men
get mullered.

190
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,499
Can't save 'em all.

191
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,250
This was no man's.

192
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,875
I was told it gets me
one cooperation.

193
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,375
Well, now.

194
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,832
Well, these boys
won't go to war for anybody.

195
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,042
You're gonna have to scrap
for their allegiance.

196
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:21,375
Call it on.

197
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:23,875
Dog!

198
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You all right?

199
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:35,957
I'm fine. Is he?

200
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,250
Next in line.

201
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,333
I do the talking.

202
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Look into the camera.

203
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,583
Four fingers.

204
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,542
Thumb.

205
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,667
Look into the camera.

206
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,792
Four fingers.

207
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:11,167
Thumb.

208
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,749
Business or pleasure?

209
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,333
- Pleasure.
- Loads of pleasure.

210
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,874
That's quite a purse.

211
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,708
It's the latest Vuitton.

212
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,041
Looks expensive.

213
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,958
It's nothing compared
to my shoe fetish.

214
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,499
Enjoy your trip.

215
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,375
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

216
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,083
The Big Apple, baby!

217
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,374
Hey, forget about it!

218
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,249
- Cab?
- Already booked.

219
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,416
Be a gentleman, would you?

220
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,375
Milady.

221
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,958
Smooth. Really smooth.

222
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,166
24 hours? You guys
gotta check out Goattles.

223
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:52,041
Stellar goat milk bar
in East Williamsburg.

224
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,249
Wanted to invest in the place,

225
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,582
but I got too many
other projects.

226
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,291
I do cab for the networking.

227
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,249
You gotta diversify
your entrepreneurial ventures

228
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,874
if you wanna make it these days.

229
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,832
I got my screen printing
business,

230
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,499
virtual reality app
and bike shop I co-own.

231
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
That's my main gig.

232
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:07,082
Ride or Die Cyclery,

233
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,416
largest selection of vintage
bikes on the East Coast.

234
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:10,666
Yeah, well, you sound like
you got your fingers

235
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,332
in a lot of little pies, mate.

236
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,999
Everyone's trying
to make it rich.

237
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,374
You just gotta try harder
than the next guy, right?

238
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,124
Well, sometimes the riches just
fall out the back of a truck

239
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,667
and land in your lap.

240
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,832
- How far to Nas Stone?
- Not far.

241
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,957
Nas Stone?
You guys ballers or gangsters?

242
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,500
Well, we ain't ballers.

243
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:09,332
I'm hearing good things
from Saul Gold about you.

244
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,749
You bringing in
the business, girl.

245
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,041
Things seem to be going well.

246
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,499
But if I understand correctly,

247
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,582
this is a little something
off the books.

248
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,457
These are my associates,
Albert Hill

249
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,538
and Charlie Cavendish-Scott.
Good to meet you, man.

250
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,707
So... I got a backlog of orders

251
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,500
stretching halfway
down the block.

252
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:34,042
Charlie, the bag?

253
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,166
Sorry, the... the what?

254
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,208
The bag, Charlie.

255
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
What bag?

256
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,500
The bag.

257
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,667
The bag!

258
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,958
Charlie?

259
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,333
How could you leave
the bag in the back

260
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:12,166
of a fucking cab, Charlie?

261
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,999
In what part of your warped
perception was this my fault

262
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,874
more than it was yours?

263
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,124
Charlie, the bag is there,
sat next to you on the seat.

264
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,707
All you have to do
is hold onto it,

265
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,291
carry it out of the cab
and into the store, Charlie!

266
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:23,541
Bollocks.

267
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:26,666
Just... it was just bad luck.

268
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,249
Okay, can... can we just
please just concentrate

269
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,530
on getting it back now? Can we?

270
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,416
Chloe, what did
the cab firm say?

271
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:36,582
"Thanks for your inquiry,
one of our team

272
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,249
will get back to you
within 48 hours."

273
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,333
We don't have 48 hours.

274
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,041
Hello, love.

275
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:56,874
I got a bad feeling
about this one, Vic.

276
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,457
About what?

277
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,292
The heist. The gold.

278
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,499
- Spain.
- No, no, no, no.

279
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,332
Nothing to worry about.
I got it handled.

280
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,832
A week from now,
we'll be coastal royalty.

281
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:16,292
Tapas and sangria
for all eternity.

282
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:20,874
What about his schooling?

283
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,166
Well, they got schools
in Costa del Sol.

284
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:25,832
Private schools.

285
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,624
Well, what about
all my friends here?

286
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,374
You'll make new friends, son.

287
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,874
I'll take you to see
Real Madrid at the Bernebéu,

288
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:37,041
and maybe get you
a summer job...

289
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:38,833
as a bullfighter.

290
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,333
Cool.

291
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,249
Stop filling my son's head
with your nonsense, Vic.

292
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,666
You wanna stay
in this shithole forever?

293
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:56,458
This is our shot. Trust me.

294
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:14,083
Eddie Flowers.

295
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,332
The tongueless wonder.

296
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,416
Still playing with knives
after what they done to ya?

297
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:20,999
Leave him be.

298
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,332
- Lily Hill.
- What do you want?

299
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,791
Well, I was just passing by.

300
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:27,832
I thought I'd pop in
and pay my respects.

301
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,707
You'd paid 'em.

302
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:33,166
How's life treating Vic?

303
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,832
You know he hasn't
written to me.

304
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,249
Not even a postcard.

305
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,125
I'm sure he'll catch up
with you one day.

306
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,166
How's that young lad of yours?

307
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,999
That gang of his?

308
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,541
They're keeping
their noses clean, are they?

309
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:47,875
- As a whistle.
- Good.

310
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,375
Good.

311
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:55,125
That room's for staff.

312
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,374
You know, I never could
smell the roses, Mrs. Hill.

313
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:05,042
But I could always sniff out
a rotten apple.

314
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:10,666
Eddie...
show the gentleman the door.

315
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,167
There's no need.

316
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,417
Send my regards to Albert.

317
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:19,832
Right, okay,
we need to find this guy.

318
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,582
Now, what do we know?
Just about everything.

319
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,582
He practically downloaded us
his life story.

320
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:26,041
- Goat milk bar.
- Screen printing business.

321
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:27,875
The virtual reality app.

322
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,000
The bike shop!

323
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:35,916
- Shit.
- Where's the bag?

324
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:37,999
What bag?

325
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,499
What do I look like?

326
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,749
Well, you're 5'10-ish,
dark, cropped hair.

327
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,582
Hazelnut eyes.
Do I look like a dick?

328
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,332
- A dick?
- Does he look like a dick?

329
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,291
No. No, I don't think
you look like a dick.

330
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:49,874
Then why are you
jerking him off like a dick?

331
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,874
Okay, okay, okay!

332
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,541
I did have your gold...
I mean bag.

333
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:54,624
But I don't anymore.

334
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,832
Right, so who has it now?

335
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,999
I... I put it up for auction.

336
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,666
Who did you put it up
for auction with, who?!

337
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:03,457
- The Xiang Sisters!
- Not good.

338
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,791
Who are the Xiang Sisters?
They sound hot.

339
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,374
Black market fences
who auction anything

340
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,083
from kidneys
to rocket launchers.

341
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,499
- Get me my gold bag.
- I can't, I can't, I swear!

342
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,124
- Get me my gold bag!
- I swear I can't.

343
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,916
All submissions
to the auction are final.

344
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:17,458
But you can get us in.

345
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,207
- Get us in!
- Okay, okay!

346
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,333
I can... I can get you
into the auction.

347
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:24,875
Well... thank you.

348
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:45,707
This time... I want Windrush.

349
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:49,749
I need the best cleaner,
nothing less.

350
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,957
Windrush still not here.

351
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:56,125
But I can introduce you
to the Murphy's Law Lads.

352
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,791
Right!

353
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:13,167
A scrap for our allegiance.
Mushy!

354
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:18,332
- And... Tall Paul!
- Yeah!

355
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,582
Billy here fights
for our cooperation!

356
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,499
- Both?
- Your dad

357
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,666
would have knocked the shite
out of both of 'em.

358
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:28,166
- Come on, Billy.
- Right!

359
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,375
Let's be having ya!

360
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,917
Wait... wait...

361
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:40,374
Come on, Billy.

362
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,000
Do your worst!

363
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:47,500
Go on there! Go on!

364
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,500
Yes, Billy!

365
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,500
Let me have a look at that.

366
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,082
You are King Royston's boy.

367
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:11,625
We shall break
your man out for you, son.

368
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,833
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
is not in service.

369
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,500
Come on, Albert.

370
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,833
Where are you?

371
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,916
Eddie, could you come
to the house please, love?

372
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:50,708
I need you to take a delivery
to Father John's for me.

373
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:01,083
Let's go.

374
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,749
Tommy... Tommy, you're
gonna be with me, right?

375
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,499
Right, then.
Let's get Norman out.

376
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,332
You're a game lad, Billy.
But we're going in heavy.

377
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,166
So you stay here
and look after the lass.

378
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:14,207
I'm going in with ya.

379
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:17,833
I am not asking you, son.

380
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:22,792
Good lad.

381
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,333
Lady Carnation, bless us.

382
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,666
Lovely, great.

383
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:35,082
And now, we are blessed.

384
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,958
- Come on, Dad!
- Right.

385
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:41,457
Let us make some noise, boys.

386
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:42,874
Yes.

387
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,583
Come on!

388
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,749
What's a didicoy?

389
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,749
I heard Uncle Dean
call you that at the campsite.

390
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,791
- A half gypsy.
- Yeah?

391
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:20,833
Which half?

392
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,375
My old man.

393
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,874
He was a traveler from up north.

394
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:35,042
My mum...

395
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,458
she was a punk singer
from the East End.

396
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,332
He was working as a bouncer
at one of her shows

397
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,500
when they met.

398
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,333
Knocked her up.

399
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:51,791
Problem was,
he was promised the daughter

400
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:54,957
of another traveler family...

401
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:57,457
and they didn't take too kindly
to him breaking up the wedding

402
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,083
and shacking up with some...

403
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:04,250
some settler slut.

404
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,499
The night I was born,
he had a little run-in

405
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,208
with his betrothed's kin.

406
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:18,167
Took 12 blades to the gut.

407
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,499
I'm so sorry, Billy.

408
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,416
Yeah, well, I'm not.

409
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,042
Never knew the guy.

410
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,792
Okay, I'm done playing!

411
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:47,082
Who the fuck are you?

412
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,042
I'm Uncle Dean, pal.

413
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:05,207
So you're a single girl.

414
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:06,667
Or available.

415
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,957
Norman, mate.
Geez, you all right?

416
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,999
Those bastards
couldn't break me, boy.

417
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,500
Come here.

418
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:29,917
Job done, lads!

419
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,583
I bloody love Pikeys.

420
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:38,582
Aren't you sweet?

421
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,333
You have impeccable taste!

422
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,082
Private party.

423
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,332
Okay.

424
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,750
Okay.

425
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:21,832
Bandit territory.

426
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,166
- Keep an eye out.
- I'll be at the bar.

427
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:26,500
It's the best vantage point, Al.

428
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,332
I'm Maggie Xiang,
and this is our house.

429
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,082
You are?

430
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:52,832
My name's Chloe Koen
and this is my client, Mr. Hill.

431
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:55,291
And what are
your client's interests?

432
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:56,692
On this occasion,
precious metals.

433
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:00,157
Then he won't be disappointed.

434
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:03,250
Booth number three.

435
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,499
All sales are final

436
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,583
and payable immediately
after sale.

437
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,332
In lot four, we have
a triple-headed vibrator

438
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,832
embellished with 100 white
and pink sapphires,

439
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,666
pearls, and diamonds.

440
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,667
Bidding starts at $100,000.

441
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,124
What can I get you there, sir?

442
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,333
I, um...

443
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,999
virgin mojito.

444
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Sure thing.

445
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,874
A must-have
for every girl in town.

446
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,041
A purse made
of solid gold ingots.

447
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:23,667
Place your bids!

448
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,332
Motek!

449
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,124
Heimels!
What are you doing here?

450
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,624
Double tequila shots all around.

451
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,666
What are <i>you</i>
doing here, Charlie?

452
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:55,749
You're a long way
from home, dog.

453
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,457
International business, fellas.

454
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:01,666
And you, you got
your eye on anything?

455
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,708
Diamonds, bubba.
Always diamonds.

456
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:20,458
Wire details for
immediate transfer, $350,000.

457
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,582
What else have you got in there?

458
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:35,999
Don't you know
it's rude to ask a girl

459
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,292
what she's got in her purse?

460
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:56,999
Business is done, Mr. Hill.

461
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,707
Time to relax.

462
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:01,541
Well, thank you very much
for your hospitality,

463
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:03,332
but we actually have
a plane to catch.

464
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,708
Stop them!

465
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:15,207
Hyuh!

466
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:17,624
Looks like you've
got problems, Charlie.

467
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:18,875
No shit, Abel.

468
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,916
We do owe you, Charlie.

469
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,166
This is a robbery!

470
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:33,499
Get me that diamond, Balabusta.

471
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,333
I think this belongs to us.

472
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,832
Sorry for theshtunk
with Saul Gold, Albert.

473
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,999
I hope he didn't pull
your trousers down too far.

474
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,457
Don't worry about it.
I'd say we're even.

475
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:44,832
Taxi!

476
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:46,166
Don't even think
about it, Schmeckel.

477
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:47,625
Brothers...

478
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,500
My man!

479
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:08,958
So...

480
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:12,457
How you want your scrilla?

481
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,833
Cash.

482
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:58,000
If you've trampled my azaleas,
you're gonna be sorry.

483
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,166
Lily, hold up.

484
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:01,583
It's me, Norman Gordon.

485
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:07,292
Jesus, Norman, you could've
just rung the doorbell.

486
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:11,958
I was... hoping not
to wake you, love.

487
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,999
You all right, mate?

488
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,832
Spot of bother, Lil.

489
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,874
I couldn't go to the hospital
on this one.

490
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,916
I'll get you a glass of water.

491
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:25,208
How 'bout a splash
of something stronger?

492
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:36,041
Well, you won't be winning
any beauty pageants, Norm,

493
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:37,999
that's for sure.

494
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,333
Just to have a shot
at entering is all I ask.

495
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:49,958
Norman?

496
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:54,000
Earth to Norman?

497
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,916
Sorry, love, heh.

498
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:01,083
Must be a bit tired.

499
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:05,750
Well, you rest up.

500
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:09,874
Sorry, love.

501
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,457
- Can you manage?
- Yeah.

502
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,500
Thank you.

503
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,160
I'll check in on you later.

504
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,332
- What's in there now?
- Go on, go on.

505
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,000
Come on. Come on.

506
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:54,332
I figure you'll be wanting
what's in this wee pouch?

507
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:56,082
And those readies are all yours.

508
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:59,332
Well, I was thinking...

509
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:03,167
about putting some Roman columns
outside my caravan.

510
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,832
You are all right with us, son.

511
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:13,499
- Thank you, Uncle Dean.
- Enjoy.

512
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,792
Thank you.

513
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:28,583
We got our diamonds back, baby!
Yes!

514
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:39,792
All right, boys,
don't stop till you've found it.

515
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,833
Vic? What happened, mate?

516
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,541
Get yourself in there.
Mind your head.

517
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:09,916
Horrible bastards,
what'd they do to ya?

518
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:13,332
Man, horrible's
not the word, Hate 'Em.

519
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:16,583
Being in the hole
is incredibly...

520
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,667
enlightening.

521
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:39,374
- Anything to declare?
- Yeah.

522
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:41,000
Don't go to New York.
