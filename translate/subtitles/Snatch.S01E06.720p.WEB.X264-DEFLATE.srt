1
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:08,082
What's the skinny
on the truck heist?

2
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,541
The street went
dark on that one.

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:10,832
Bob Fink was here yesterday.

4
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:11,833
He didn't find the gold though.

5
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:13,666
I moved it to Father John's.

6
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,457
So, what's the price to keep
my commodity safe and sound?

7
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,291
That depends on the value
of the commodity.

8
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:19,791
I need something, um...
unexpected.

9
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:22,749
- A bathtub.
- A solid gold bathtub.

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,249
- So, can you do it? Make a gold bathtub?
- I'll give it a crack.

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,125
Albert Hill!
You've been a naughty boy!

12
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,332
Lily Hill, I am arresting you on
possessing prohibited weapons.

13
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,874
- We need to get out of town.
- My family's place

14
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,416
in the country.
I hope it's comfy, Charlie,

15
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:37,697
'cause we might
be there a while.

16
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:50,666
<i>When the gold free-for-all was</i>
declared in the summer of '01,

17
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:53,542
<i>everyone knew it was gonna</i>
get a little naughty.

18
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:59,499
Oi, love, move out the way!

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,000
<i>But no one was prepared</i> for the
rank slaughter that followed.

20
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,457
<i>It played out like</i>
a gangland's who's who

21
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,582
<i>kicking off</i>
with the Topper Clan.

22
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,666
<i>But the gold wouldn't</i>
keep quiet.

23
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:13,957
<i>And the Worthington Crew</i>
heard the whispers.

24
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:16,457
<i>And by the time</i>
the leaves started falling,

25
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,000
so did the Toppers.

26
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:27,291
<i>Jury's still out on who ironed</i>
out the Worthington Crew.

27
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:31,416
Maybe the Harriston Yardies.

28
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:33,000
Maybe the Maripole Ladies.

29
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:38,874
<i>Makes no once</i>
who did what and when?

30
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,999
They're all history now.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,874
<i>The gold changed hands</i>
over a dozen times

32
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:48,666
<i>as whole gangs</i>
were wiped from the map.

33
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,125
All for a lump of metal.

34
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,082
No!

35
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,999
<i>Although I've never known</i>
a curse that could out-muscle

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,166
<i>that most basic</i>
of all human instincts...

37
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,542
greed.

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,332
<i>Does he have the stones,</i>
the diamonds?

39
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,375
<i>Where are you</i>
taking the diamonds?!

40
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:57,750
Wow.

41
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,332
Cousin Monty was a pimp!

42
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,124
Well, actually,
an Earl to be precise.

43
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,582
If your Cousin is an Earl,
what does that make you?

44
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, nothing more
than the cousin of an Earl.

45
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,166
Your money or your life, scum!

46
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,041
Shit.

47
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,249
God!

48
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,166
This is spectacular, Charlie.

49
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,999
Would you like a tour, Chloe?

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,042
I'd love one.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,999
Oi, Charlie boy!

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,666
Where's the booze?

53
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,957
Yeah, the...
Head east through the parlor.

54
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,166
The wine cellar is through an
oak door down some stairs.

55
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:46,707
Pick a full-bodied red.

56
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,166
The dustier
the bottle the better.

57
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:51,125
Got it, mate.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,374
Are you not forgetting
something?!

59
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,917
Like a 10 million pound gold
bathtub in the back of the van!

60
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,957
312!

61
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,916
Cell 313!

62
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:09,666
Death, taxes, and count.

63
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,916
The only certainties in life.

64
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:14,707
And I intend to defy all three.

65
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,416
Cell 314?

66
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:18,832
We're right here, Screw,
exactly where you left us.

67
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,167
Piece of shit.

68
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,500
- What now?
- Go and have a fag.

69
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,957
Spread the word, Hate 'Em.

70
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:35,457
The Mad Hatters Tea Party
will commence tomorrow.

71
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,833
We'll take the whole wing down
the rabbit hole, Vic.

72
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,374
Who'd shoot a clergyman?

73
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,624
Father John wasn't
exactly a saint.

74
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,499
Gotta rap sheet longer
than the New Testament.

75
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,291
Witness says they were
negotiating

76
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:52,707
with a bunch of sheikhs over
what looked like a gold bath.

77
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,666
A gold bath?

78
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,332
Anything else?

79
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,041
Yeah, he's given us a name.

80
00:04:58,042 --> 00:04:59,542
Bob Fink.

81
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:10,332
Mrs. Hill, possessing an
unlicensed firearm

82
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,374
is a very serious offense.

83
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,583
So is planting evidence.

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,667
I'll be taking my phone call now
if you don't mind.

85
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:27,082
Come on, Lil,
have a look around.

86
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,041
There's no mics, no cameras.

87
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:31,291
Just a chat.

88
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:35,207
I can make all of this go away.

89
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,666
You can make
a fake charge go away?

90
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:41,332
Forgive me
while I hold the applause.

91
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,249
Have you any idea
just how much shit

92
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,249
your boy and his mates are in?

93
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,332
I mean, there's enough naughty
on this list

94
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,332
to give Santa a stroke.

95
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,832
He goes away, it'll make
his old man's stretch

96
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,832
look like a weekend in Margate!

97
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:57,457
All I want is
a word with Albert.

98
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,832
Straighten up this mess.

99
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,833
Do a deal.

100
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:03,624
Keep everyone happy.

101
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,249
Can't you see I'm trying
to throw you a line here?

102
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,750
I want my phone call.

103
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,666
Call your boy.

104
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,542
I'm calling my lawyer.

105
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:30,333
I'll give you some more time
to consider my proposition.

106
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:41,125
And finally,
this is the master bedroom.

107
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:48,292
Charlie...

108
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,291
This is beautiful.

109
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:55,541
Yeah, well...
Sleep here if you like.

110
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:57,374
No...

111
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,332
No, I really couldn't.

112
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,416
Could I?

113
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:02,667
- Call shotgun.
- Shotgun!

114
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,166
Wow.

115
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,499
Yeah, well, I'm,
I'm gonna go to...

116
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,124
light the fire.

117
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,333
Come down to the library when
you've... finished spinning.

118
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:47,374
Tell you what, I could get used
to this, Charlie.

119
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,207
Certainly in no rush to leave.

120
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,999
Well, it's too hot to go home
now anyway, isn't it?

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,499
Yeah, well, it's been
a rough week.

122
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,332
I say we get absolutely
hammered.

123
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,457
Whoa!

124
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,792
Think we can help with that.

125
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,667
Whoo!

126
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,417
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

127
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,000
Whoo!

128
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,957
Fun and games today, boys?!

129
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,999
Fun and games, today!

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,124
Matinee movie, Hate 'Em?!

131
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,041
Special features, chaps.

132
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:17,875
And you don't want to miss it.

133
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,041
Hey.

134
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:32,667
Someone's messing
with the tea, over there.

135
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,750
In the office now.

136
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,707
He's put some shit in there,
I don't know what.

137
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,041
Sounds like they
spiked the tea urns.

138
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:45,999
Check the damn milk.

139
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,582
<i>All inmates!</i>

140
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,666
<i>Return to your cells</i>
immediately!

141
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:53,417
<i>I repeat, all inmates return</i>
to your cells immediately!

142
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:01,624
I need a coffee.

143
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,291
Yeah, I need two coffees.

144
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,999
I'm starving.

145
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,166
Yeah, Charlie, where's the food?

146
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,874
There is no food.

147
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,999
I told you, no one's been
here in over two years.

148
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,916
All right, keep your
toys in your pram.

149
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,749
Is there a market nearby?

150
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,999
Nearest village is...
About two miles away.

151
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,582
- Fancy a drive?
- I could do with some air.

152
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,874
Yeah, you can take
Cousin Monty's car.

153
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,542
It's in the barn.

154
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,457
Cousin Monty

155
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,708
- really is a pimp!
- Yes, he is.

156
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:46,582
So, seeing as we are both
in this together,

157
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,707
maybe we should get to know
each other a little.

158
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,207
What, ask a few questions

159
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,792
and then we get
friendship bracelets?

160
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,375
Do me a favor.

161
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:58,541
You smoke?

162
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:01,332
See, you're getting
to know me already.

163
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,957
Alright, I'll play.

164
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,166
What's a pretty girl
from New York

165
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:07,999
doing working
for a fence like Saul Gold?

166
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,499
Well, I went
traveling for a year.

167
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,499
I always wanted to go to London.

168
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,666
So, I ended up waitressing
at a coffee shop to pay my way.

169
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,166
Saul walked in.

170
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:19,666
Took a flyer off
the counter on anger management

171
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,707
and offered me a job.

172
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,666
Said he was doing one good
deed a day.

173
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,291
Adventure comes to the
adventurous, right?

174
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:29,083
So, I took him up on his offer.

175
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,458
What's the real story, ay?

176
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,166
We're out of wood.

177
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:39,082
We need to go
and chop some logs.

178
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,499
Chop some logs?
How do we do that?

179
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,416
With an ax, you idiot.

180
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:43,666
Who you calling an idiot?

181
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:44,874
Well, there is only
one person here

182
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,207
who doesn't know
how to chop logs.

183
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,333
Have I done something
to offend you, Charlie?

184
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:52,999
Do you know how to chop logs?

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,292
Yeah, with an ax... you idiot.

186
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,499
I had a very normal life.

187
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,874
Decent parents,
did well at school.

188
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,624
Never wanted for
anything really.

189
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:07,082
It was a middle class life
with no real struggles at all.

190
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,874
Ooh, sounds really boring.

191
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,416
It was boring beyond belief.

192
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,624
I hated my life.

193
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,666
It was like a slow death.

194
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:21,082
And what do your parents think
about you working for a fence?

195
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,666
They think
I'm studying accounting

196
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,208
at the London School
of Economics.

197
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,832
I forged my graduation
certificate

198
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,792
and sent it home last month.

199
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,500
You're alright, Chloe Koen.

200
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,166
So, what are we gonna
do about this gold bath?

201
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,166
That was a bright
idea wasn't it.

202
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,207
Actually, it was
a very good idea.

203
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,916
Just not one your bird's had.

204
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:47,999
Well, first of all, Charlie,
she ain't my bird.

205
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,541
And secondly, she's the one

206
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,249
who put us onto the gold
in the first place.

207
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,582
Actually, technically,
she put us onto

208
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,374
Sonny Castillo's truck.

209
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,791
We happened upon that gold.

210
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,916
And forget who has
and hasn't done what.

211
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:00,082
We gotta think about what
we're gonna do with it now.

212
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,666
Yeah, what are we gonna
do now, Maestro?

213
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,874
Hole up in the country
and set up a commune?

214
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,499
I'm thinking on my
feet here, aren't I?

215
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,375
More like sleeping on your feet.

216
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,166
What has gotten into you?

217
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,499
He thinks you're
putting moves on her.

218
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,832
Putting the moves on who?

219
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,499
Chloe.

220
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,249
I am not putting
the moves on Chloe!

221
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,249
So what's the deal with
you and Albert then?

222
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,166
Me and Albert?!

223
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:25,167
Nothing, it is just business.

224
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:27,582
You want to bang him.

225
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,916
I do not want to bang him.

226
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:31,875
I can see what's going on.

227
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:37,291
Hushed conversations,
cuddles on the sofa.

228
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,916
You put your arm around her.

229
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:41,707
Tread carefully.

230
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,542
The posh one's got
a hard-on for you.

231
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,332
Charlie?

232
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,041
You are properly
paranoid here, Charlie.

233
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:49,999
He... he's probably obsessed.

234
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,792
I'm not obsessed!

235
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,291
I'm in love!

236
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,499
No, he...

237
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,833
he's just really so sweet.

238
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,833
Charlie!

239
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,124
You've known the girl
for five minutes!

240
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,749
There is no time,
space or motion

241
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,666
in the matter of the heart!

242
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,041
But not that you would know
that, Billy,

243
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:27,832
'cause yours is carved
out of solid oak.

244
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,374
You're damn straight.

245
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,999
Ain't nothing in those
fairy tales for me, mate.

246
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,624
You couldn't leave this one
alone, could you?

247
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:37,041
- Me?
- What chance would I have anyway?

248
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:40,291
When Albert Hill rode into town
on his stallion...

249
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:42,249
With his spurs jangling

250
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,292
and his six shooter glistening
in the high sun.

251
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,833
Just this one time!

252
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,833
Just one bloody time.

253
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,292
Charlie?

254
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,458
Charlie!

255
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,875
I want my bloody phone call!

256
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:09,666
Who's that one?

257
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:10,916
Lily Hill.

258
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:13,332
- Vic Hill's wife.
- Yeah.

259
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,166
Bob Fink brought her in.

260
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,291
Fink brought her in?

261
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:19,292
On what charge?

262
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:21,666
Possession of illegal firearms.

263
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,499
Left her in there all night.

264
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
- He charge her yet?
- Not yet.

265
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:32,957
What was all that about?

266
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,166
What, are we still 14
fighting over girls?

267
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,124
What you asking me for?

268
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,832
Apparently I've got
a heart of wooden oak.

269
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,792
Something bothering
you too, now, is it?

270
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,332
Well...

271
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,749
This whole thing has been one
cock up to the next,

272
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,541
ain't it, really?

273
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,583
Okay, so this
is all my fault, is it?

274
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:55,832
Losing the fight?

275
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,207
The Castillo heist.

276
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,832
Father John getting ironed out.

277
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,124
Bob Fink coming after us.
The gold bath tub.

278
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,249
Listen, I apologize if my efforts
haven't quite gone to plan.

279
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,749
But I haven't seen you trying to get
us ahead over the years, Billy.

280
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,666
In case you want to know,
I look after everyone.

281
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,166
Well, maybe I don't
want to get ahead.

282
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,416
Maybe I'm alright where I am.

283
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,666
Billy, you live in a closet.

284
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,582
What's your excuse? You're a talented
fighter and you don't even train.

285
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,124
You could have a run
at going pro.

286
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,208
And who says I want
a run at going pro?

287
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,124
That was always your idea.

288
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,485
Yeah, well, one of us has got
to be ambitious, haven't we?

289
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,207
That's not what this
is about, Al.

290
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,499
What it is about then, Billy,
ay, tell me?

291
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,999
It's about you and your
old man, always has been.

292
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,957
You trying to prove
to him and everyone else

293
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,332
that you can get one up on him.

294
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,833
That you can live up
to the Hill name.

295
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,166
My old man's got
nothing to do with this.

296
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,583
Come on, Al.

297
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:51,416
Heisting an armored
truck with a forklift?

298
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:54,166
Ooh, that's straight
out of Vic Hill's handbook.

299
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:57,874
Boiler suits? JCB's Masks?

300
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,875
That's Vic Hill 2.0.

301
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,000
You might wanna take a look
in the mirror... mate.

302
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,000
Dailies, boys!

303
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:28,167
As Hate 'Em said,
it's gonna be a mindbender.

304
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,457
What's the problem here, gents?

305
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,166
What's the problem?
Hoochin' the tea, you scumbag.

306
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,541
Hoochin' what tea?
What you talkin' about?

307
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:42,416
Come on, come here, you!

308
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:43,457
Get off me!

309
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,833
Come on, stop struggling.

310
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,499
Like he said boys,

311
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,375
Crossword's a mindbender.

312
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,167
And you don't wanna miss it.

313
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:09,500
- All in.
- All in.

314
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,041
Hill! Get in there!

315
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:21,332
Full lockdown.

316
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,499
Haven't had
my morning cuppa yet.

317
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,207
Your scheme to mass medicate
the wing

318
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,832
has been brought
to my attention.

319
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,793
I haven't a clue what you're
jabbering on about.

320
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:32,042
A little bird whispered
the milk's off.

321
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:43,666
Where is that filthy
midnight grass?

322
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:44,832
I'll fuckin' shit him!

323
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:45,874
You won't see him again.

324
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,999
Transferred for loyal service.

325
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,667
Dump the whole lot, lads!

326
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:55,499
Oi! No morning tea?

327
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,249
That's a breach of our human
rights, wouldn't you say?

328
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,041
Now both of you,
back in your kennel.

329
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:02,457
I want my brew,
and I want my paper now.

330
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,957
Now!

331
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,874
I do believe this prisoner's
become unruly.

332
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:09,749
Never too early for a screw
bashing, now, is it, Screw, ay?

333
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,291
Oi, Vic, you don't wanna
go back in the hole.

334
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:14,249
These two were set
to boil up the wing!

335
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,874
A kicking's
the least they deserve.

336
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,332
You behave yourself.

337
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,374
Listen...

338
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,832
We need them out of here
quick and quiet.

339
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:22,874
We don't want them
stirring up the mob.

340
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,457
Stick 'em over in Barmy Wing.

341
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,291
Spot of potion and they're
someone else's problem.

342
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,499
I ain't going back to Loony bin.

343
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,874
I ain't going back to Loony bin,

344
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,500
no way, no way, no way!

345
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,167
Vic! Vic!

346
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,916
- I'll kill you.
- Everyone take 'em out! Out!

347
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,208
Take 'em to the Barmy wing!

348
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,041
Mr. Hill, you were due
to be out soon.

349
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:01,082
But now you're due to receive
another 18 months

350
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,500
for assaulting
a member of the prison staff.

351
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,457
Why jeopardize your release?

352
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,166
Screw deserved more than he got.

353
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,957
But surely you want
to get out of here?

354
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,124
Yeah, and miss
all this good fun?

355
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:17,999
So, Henry, um,
looking at your folder...

356
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,082
It's "Hate 'Em."

357
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,999
Hate 'Em All Henry.

358
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,791
Hate 'Em All Henry.

359
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:28,749
Do you have reservations for
what life holds on the outside?

360
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,332
I've been locked up
for 15 years.

361
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,013
I wouldn't know where to get
a reservation.

362
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,874
Anger management issues.

363
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:40,166
Aggressive and violent
tendencies.

364
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,499
When did it start, Henry?

365
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,166
Have It All, what... Hate All...

366
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:48,332
Hate 'Em All.

367
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,957
Shut up.

368
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,291
Are you scared, Vic?

369
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:57,999
Scared what those expectations
might be?

370
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,707
As a husband... as a father?

371
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,375
Terrified.

372
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,374
I miss my birds.

373
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,124
I need you
to speak to the Guv'nor

374
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,999
and ask him to give me
my birds back.

375
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,374
What, what birds exactly are,
are you talking about?

376
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,707
Well, Mr. Hill,
so far as I can gauge,

377
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,499
you've experienced
extreme anxiety

378
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,291
relating to your
imminent release.

379
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:31,457
We call it gate fever.

380
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,957
Sounds contagious.

381
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:36,332
And you use humor
to deflect the anxiety,

382
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,957
particularly relating
to the expectations

383
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,582
put upon you
by your wife and son.

384
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,332
I'm Vic Hill.

385
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,291
I've had my fair
share of hard knocks.

386
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:47,332
I've been down on the mat more
times than I can count,

387
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,374
but I have never been licked
by expectations.

388
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,499
What birds?
What you mean what birds?

389
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,541
I, I, I think I'm gonna give
you a small dose...

390
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,832
- You what?
- Help!

391
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,416
Mr. Hill, I am going to give
you a small dose...

392
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,166
Give me the drugs,
give me the drugs,

393
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:00,687
give me the drugs,
give me the drugs...

394
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,083
Give us them keys.

395
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:56,832
Are you still there?

396
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,542
No!

397
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,332
No!

398
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,083
Hold still, hold still.
There you go.

399
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,707
You'll be asleep
in about five seconds.

400
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,583
Good night.

401
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,541
Yeah, Hate 'Em All.

402
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,833
And don't forget it.

403
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,791
White chocolate.

404
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:46,917
My favorite.

405
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:55,332
Dailies, boys!

406
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,166
Crossword's a mindbender.

407
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:00,374
Like he said, boys,
crossword's a mindbender.

408
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,083
And you don't wanna miss it.

409
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,166
Let's get ourselves out.

410
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:29,500
Come on.

411
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:51,707
Fly!

412
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,374
Fly free, you nutters!

413
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,667
Fly free, you nutters!

414
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,333
Hey, come here.

415
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,166
Coming through, doctors,
coming through.

416
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:06,542
Doctors coming through.

417
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,916
Injured officer!
Injured officer.

418
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:16,249
Injured officer!

419
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,166
Injured officer, coming through!

420
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,874
Injured officer,
injured officer.

421
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,166
- Are you all right?
- Injured officer.

422
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,332
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes.

423
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,582
Wonderful, wonderful.

424
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:25,499
That's very... yes.

425
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,167
Vic, you drive.

426
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:32,167
Injured officer,
injured officer.

427
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:42,208
You did it.

428
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,500
What the hell?

429
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:59,541
Bloody hooligans.

430
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:00,999
Scooter?

431
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,749
Scooter?!

432
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,082
Come on, boy.

433
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,124
Where are you, boy?

434
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,458
Scooter?!

435
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:30,166
Good boy.

436
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:32,332
What are you doing, ay?

437
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,666
Good boy.

438
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:35,958
Flying Squad.

439
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,458
Dwyer.

440
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,374
Chief Superintendent Jones.

441
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,666
A horse got out of the paddock
this afternoon, sir.

442
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,249
Vic Hill escaped.

443
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,374
Took a guard hostage
and staged a riot.

444
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,666
Vic Hill...

445
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,207
Well, it's par for the course.

446
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:07,999
He's as mad as a box of frogs.

447
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,707
Sir, the very man who hijacked
the gold bullion

448
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,499
in the first place is now
walking the pavement

449
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,166
at the precise moment
that same gold bullion

450
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:16,124
has staged its comeback tour.

451
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,832
Interesting timing,
I'll say you that.

452
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:20,916
Interesting timing.
It's Vic Bloody Hill.

453
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:24,207
The gold has been on the
streets for seven days.

454
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:27,207
And you have
how many leads, exactly?

455
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:30,082
We don't have a solid lead
as of yet, sir, but...

456
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,999
Then I suggest...

457
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,958
You focus your attention on
finding and locating Hill.

458
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:41,166
He may be more effective
at locating the gold

459
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:43,375
than your entire unit, Dwyer.

460
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,750
And Dwyer?

461
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,750
Sir?

462
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,374
Screw this up, and I'll put you

463
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:52,125
over my knee and take
my pound of flesh.

464
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,417
Understood, sir.

465
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,375
Hello, fellas.

466
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,374
What have got here, then?

467
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:14,957
Nice touch, good boy.

468
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,291
There's one in there for you,
too, Vic.

469
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:17,541
Great, thanks.

470
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,124
So, what's the crack now then?

471
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:20,666
Well, by now they'll think
we're taking you hostage

472
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:21,999
'cause we made sure the knife

473
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,499
was good and clear
on the cameras.

474
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,582
When you go down to the nick,

475
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,166
tell 'em we played nice,
all right?

476
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:28,582
Will do. Don't you worry.

477
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:29,999
I'll spin a nice yarn
for you boys, all right?

478
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,291
Good boy.

479
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:33,208
And this is just
to make it look real.

480
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,291
Bloody 'ell.

481
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:37,541
That's twice you clocked me now.

482
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:38,916
Don't worry,
you'll thank us for it.

483
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:40,917
Early retirement,
all the trimmings!

484
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:46,083
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

485
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:49,458
Wrap him up, wrap him up.

486
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:15,832
It may have all
changed around here, Vic.

487
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,167
Some things never change,
Hate 'Em.

488
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:21,916
What happened here then?

489
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:23,457
Probably vandals.

490
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,178
This would never have
happened on our watch.

491
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,124
Lily?!

492
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,249
I could murder a pint now.

493
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,500
Yeah, you read my mind, Dear.

494
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,542
Morning, morning.

495
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,667
Well, hey...!

496
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:12,750
Let's have him.

497
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:18,333
Hands up in the air!
This is a robbery!

498
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,791
Afternoon, Alf.
Everything in order?

499
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:25,667
Vic Hill! Hate 'Em All Henry!

500
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,041
When did you two get out?

501
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:30,582
About... 37 minutes ago.

502
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,999
I take it not
out the front door?

503
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,624
As a matter of fact, we did.

504
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,957
Through the front door, Alf.

505
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:37,499
I get you, less said, right.

506
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,957
Okay, drinks.

507
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:40,457
Thought you wouldn't ask, Alf.

508
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,666
Two pints for me.
Vic, what you having?

509
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,832
Single malt.
The good stuff mind.

510
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:48,332
All right. No-no-no-no.

511
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,166
This is on the house, gents.

512
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:51,499
Very kind of you, Alf,
thank you.

513
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,041
So, what's new in the manor?

514
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:55,042
Yeah, what's not?

515
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:56,416
Everyone's disappeared.

516
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,124
They're either in the ground
or inside.

517
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,916
What about the crew that
flipped that security truck?

518
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:02,624
Any word on the metal?

519
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,249
It's a mystery.

520
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,624
Not so much as a whisper.

521
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:07,207
- Not a whisper.
- No, nothing.

522
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:08,999
- Quiet as a mouse.
- I thought you two would know.

523
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,208
Nothing to do with us.

524
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,541
You all right, Albert?

525
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:18,167
Yeah, I'm all right.

526
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,000
It's quite something, isn't it?

527
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:28,582
You reckon
it'll change anything?

528
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:30,457
I think what
will change anything?

529
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,333
Selling the gold,
all that money?

530
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:36,791
Yeah.

531
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:37,832
We'll be rich.

532
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:40,666
And that matters does it?

533
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:44,916
Honestly... I've got no idea.

534
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:47,124
I've never really had a bean.

535
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,416
Me neither.

536
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:51,832
There is a simple answer,
though.

537
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,499
Which is?

538
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,332
Well, we sell the gold,
get the money and find out.

539
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,958
That's the most sense
I've heard all day.

540
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,292
Charlie? What's wrong?

541
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:22,999
Me.

542
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,083
I'm what's wrong.

543
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,874
Do you take me seriously, Chloe?

544
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,999
Of course I take
you seriously, Charlie.

545
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,167
No, I, I mean... in that way?

546
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,666
Well, I... We haven't...

547
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:45,333
Sorry, that was...
not fair of me to ask.

548
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:00,207
- Boss.
- Oi.

549
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,707
Lily Hill, what cell is she in?

550
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,416
Well, she's gone, sir.

551
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:04,666
There's nothing
on the charge sheet.

552
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:06,249
I had to let her go
this afternoon.

553
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,749
Go where?
Who signed her release?

554
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,042
Flying Squad.

555
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,708
Lily.

556
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:23,999
You keep an eye out front.

557
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,291
If the plod show up
send me a smoke signal.

558
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:28,291
Don't you worry, Vic,
I've got you covered.

559
00:36:28,292 --> 00:36:30,166
If I'm not back
in half an hour...

560
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:31,832
Run free, Lassie.

561
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,833
Run free.

562
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:25,917
Lily?

563
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,042
Whoo.

564
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,167
Let's eat, guys.

565
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:44,791
Well?

566
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:48,041
We didn't cook all this bloody
food for it to go cold.

567
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:49,458
Okay.

568
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:53,791
Toast.

569
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:58,457
Yeah, here's to you
and here's to me.

570
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:02,499
The very best
that friends can be.

571
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,124
And if we ever disagree...

572
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:07,875
Well, piss off and here's to me.

573
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:18,374
Okay.

574
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:22,541
Well, it's in the most
difficult times

575
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:24,542
that we learn who
our true friends are.

576
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:31,624
Whether we've known each other
for ten days...

577
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,667
or ten years.

578
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:37,832
There's one absolute truth.

579
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:40,957
Despite all of us feeling
this excruciatingly

580
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:44,707
painful shit shock
of the last 48 hours.

581
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:47,582
There's nowhere I'd rather be
then right here,

582
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:51,874
drinking this really,
really nice wine

583
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:56,457
at Cousin Monty's...

584
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:58,417
with all of you.

585
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,042
To friends.

586
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:07,166
Friends.

587
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:08,332
Yeah.

588
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,707
To friends.

589
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,457
Friends.

590
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,375
Now tuck in.

591
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:24,667
Shit!

592
00:39:24,668 --> 00:39:26,958
- What?
- It's my mum.

593
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,167
She's been arrested.

594
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,541
So, you coming or what?

595
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,541
Seems like you and Chloe
got it covered.

596
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:43,499
I'll stay out the way. Charlie,
we don't have time for this.

597
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,999
- Please get in the van.
- No.

598
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,207
I'm gonna stay here
for a day or two.

599
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,416
Clear the mind.

600
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:51,000
You're getting
this all wrong, mate.

601
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,499
- Let's go.
- Charlie not coming?

602
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,291
Apparently not.

603
00:40:02,292 --> 00:40:03,832
What are we gonna do
about that thing?

604
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:05,124
We're gonna take it
back to Uncle Dean.

605
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:07,124
It's too risky to take
back into town.

606
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:09,957
Tell the sheikh we're gonna
need a new buyer.

607
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:11,198
He's gonna have to re-smelt it.

608
00:40:22,292 --> 00:40:23,542
Guinness up.

609
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,541
You gonna eat that or what?

610
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:36,457
All yours, Hate 'Em.

611
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:38,292
Lovely.

612
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,333
How'd she leave
without her purse?

613
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,457
Well, there's...

614
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:52,333
Some unsavory characters out
there, Vic.

615
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:56,875
None of whom seem
to remember who we are.

616
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,292
Need a place
to hole up, Hate 'Em.

617
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,374
Who do we know
that would welcome us

618
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:07,832
into their loving embrace?

619
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:08,999
A bit more vino?

620
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,416
No, thank you, Norm.

621
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:12,917
That was amazing, thank you.

622
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,999
Don't sound so surprised.

623
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,124
When you've lived on your tod
for as long as I have,

624
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:22,832
takeaways and TV dinners
lose their appeal.

625
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,500
Anybody in the mix, Norman?

626
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:28,416
Now, that's a nice
thought Lil, but...

627
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:29,417
I think that boat's sailed.

628
00:41:29,418 --> 00:41:30,999
Nah...

629
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,582
And to be honest,
I haven't really been looking.

630
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:36,125
Why not?

631
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,792
Why do you think, Lil?

632
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,667
Norman...

633
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,874
Norman, please don't
look at me like that.

634
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:57,625
Lily, it's time you knew
how I feel about...

635
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,707
Expecting visitors?

636
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:04,167
No.

637
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:13,958
Blimey! What are you doing here?

638
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:17,291
We broke out.

639
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:19,957
- You broke out?
- Nice to see you, yeah.

640
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:22,124
It's good to see you, Vic,
but, you know, I've really...

641
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,291
It's not a very good time.

642
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:24,416
You sly old fox.

643
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,082
Who you hiding in the boudoir?!

644
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:28,333
- No, no, it's just...
- Hello? Come on out, darling!
