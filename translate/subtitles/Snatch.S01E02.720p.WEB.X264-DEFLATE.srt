1
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:09,083
- Happy New Year, Dad.
- Happy New Year, Albert. Take this.

2
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:11,875
<i>Albert needs to understand,
if he's gonna play the game,</i>

3
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:13,083
he needs to go in heavy.

4
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:14,999
You keep your beak
out of it, Vic Hill.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,240
<i>Come on, Charlie, you know
we need as much cash as we can</i>

6
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:18,351
to bet on Billy's fight tonight.

7
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,000
<i>I have a very rare fob watch.</i>

8
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:22,832
I'd like an appraisal
for a sale.

9
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,458
Sonny's got a collection
going out this morning.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,332
<i>- I give you the route.</i>
- Two trucks?

11
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:30,917
<i>You figure out the best place
to hit the truck.</i>

12
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,708
- We've rung the bell.
- Hell, yeah.

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,458
That's gangsta!

14
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,375
Time to hustle, Vic. We'll come
back tomorrow and fill our boots.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,042
One for me, one for the
wife, one for Albert,

16
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,542
and one for luck.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,750
Put it away. No.

18
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:17,417
Let's see who it is
and have a nice, quiet word.

19
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,125
Get down!

20
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,583
Aah!

21
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,208
- Freeze!
- Stay down!

22
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Bob?

23
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:53,499
Don't shoot!

24
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,083
You dirty son of a bitch!

25
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,625
Your double-crossed me, Fink!

26
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,343
So, you're telling me
there was two trucks?

27
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,768
Yeah, two exactly the same trucks,
passing me at exactly the same time.

28
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,309
So, which one
did you choose, Charlie?

29
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,851
The one that looked
just like the other one.

30
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,333
Fair play.
Sonny wasn't shipping gold.

31
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,726
So you have no idea
whose gold this is?

32
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,250
Yeah... yeah we do.

33
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,999
It's ours!

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,332
And this mountain of auriferous

35
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,625
has gotta be worth
bloody millions.

36
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,999
It's official... we can retire.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,643
Can't retire if you've
never worked, knob head.

38
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:07,792
Yeah, of course you can.

39
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,184
My father hasn't worked
a day in his life.

40
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,726
Beginning to think
I hadn't been so blessed.

41
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,832
Thank you, God!

42
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,000
- Nobody's retirin'.
- Here we go.

43
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,976
We have stumbled
across a fortune in gold bullion

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,833
with no clue what dangerous
bastard it belongs to.

45
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,809
We have zero experience
in trading precious metals,

46
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,934
and if we start making inquiries

47
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,309
to the wrong fence,
we'll come unstuck

48
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,958
quicker than shit
moves through a goose.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,458
No. We stash all of it,

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,684
all of it until we know
who and what we're dealing with.

51
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,375
Then what? Suppose
you got a spare safe

52
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:32,625
knockin' around here?

53
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,208
Shut up.

54
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:48,000
There are some advantages to
being the son of a bank robber.

55
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,167
Good boy, Smudger,
just stick 'em on the shelf.

56
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,000
Oi. Be careful, sloppy bollocks.

57
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,625
Shit. Sorry.

58
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,958
What are you doin'?

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,750
Watchin' them young tarts and
old farts, skinny little pedo?

60
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:14,875
Some kids posted a video
clip on Instagram.

61
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:17,667
It's a... security truck
gettin' boosted.

62
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,500
Give us that here.

63
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,351
It's impossible to make
a dishonest livin' these days

64
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,750
without gettin' a camera
shoved in your face.

65
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,833
These mobile devices
have spawned

66
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,666
a generation of grasses.

67
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:32,833
Hey, Vic, you should
take a look at this, mate.

68
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,792
It's a bullion heist.

69
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,458
- Bullion?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,083
Here you are. Take a look.

71
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,542
I mean, talk about
a two-pronged attack?

72
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,667
Boom! Opened up that van
like a can of beans.

73
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,125
This giving you
a stiffy, Peters?

74
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,167
Speaking' of pricks...

75
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,667
- You seen it, then?
- Yeah, it's called "viral," Bob.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,417
You goin' after it?

77
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,958
Bob, you're CTF.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,292
Isn't there a shipment of BB guns
that need confiscatin' somewhere?

79
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,333
Listen... Teri.

80
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:32,083
I know about gold heists.
I did a bit of work

81
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:36,000
with Flying Squad,
I mean, I... I can help.

82
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:41,417
Yeah. All right, then, Bob. I'll have
an Americano and an almond croissant.

83
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,999
Right. I think we should move a couple of
ingots for a bit of running about money.

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,720
Yeah. We're all a little bit
short, right?

85
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:53,143
No. Not one single ingot. Right?
No one talks about the gold,

86
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,708
nobody knows about the gold,

87
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:56,332
nobody even thinks
about the gold.

88
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,768
The gold doesn't exist,
are we clear?

89
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,792
God, you're such a pill
sometimes, Al.

90
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:05,500
It's Lotti Mott.

91
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:06,875
- Shit.
- Shit.

92
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,208
Keep your business off text!

93
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,583
<i>We need to talk.</i>

94
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,500
<i>Hello, Sidney?</i>

95
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,417
Mr. Gold?

96
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:46,167
Sidney, don't get emotional.

97
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,333
Thanks to all this, I've gotta find
someone else for the job today.

98
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,958
Stop, please.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,625
I've always got top results.
Whatever it takes...

100
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:58,125
I have no complaints
regarding your skills.

101
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,625
In fact, our mutual friend
there is something of a legend,

102
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,832
and that's a compliment
to you, Sidney.

103
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,708
Cost me a pretty penny,
I'll tell ya.

104
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,000
Goes by the name of...

105
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,208
Windrush.

106
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,125
He's the best hired hand
money can buy.

107
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,833
No... no... please, Mr. Gold!

108
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:21,750
Alas, Sidney, you're
something of a schmuck.

109
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:26,000
Now I know this because having
decided that no one's gonna notice

110
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,875
if you steal one of my paintings
from the Venice job...

111
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:33,000
<i>Saul, please...</i> -...you go
and pinch the middle section

112
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:35,500
of the Whore
of Babylon triptych!

113
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,250
Please, Mr. Gold!

114
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,999
Saul Gold and Associates.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,542
Saul. Vic Hill.

116
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,333
Vic?

117
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,499
How's Her Majesty
treatin' you, then?

118
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,333
Well, I can't grumble, Saul,
and if I did, who'd listen?

119
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:09,083
So, what can I do you for?

120
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,917
You hear anythin' about the
bullion heist last night?

121
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,458
Forklifts and piggys.

122
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,833
I seen the video.
It's tidy work.

123
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,976
Actually reminded me the sort
of work you might've done.

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,667
Anybody ringin' your bell?
Tryin' to move the consignment?

125
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,917
Not a peep.

126
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,042
Why the inquiry?

127
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,667
Well, I'm just sniffin' about.

128
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,332
It gets a bit stale
in here, Saul.

129
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,583
Imagination runs wild.

130
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:35,184
Well, if you're looking for action, I
might have something to put your way.

131
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,458
I need a couple of cool heads
for a job this afternoon.

132
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,000
Low risk, going rates.
Got a face that fits?

133
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:48,583
We took a vote. Decided
to pass on your offer.

134
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:53,125
Yeah, haven't quite reached the armed
robbery phase in our projected careers.

135
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,458
We didn't hit
your boyfriend's truck.

136
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,167
I know you didn't.

137
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,625
So what's with the sit down?

138
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:02,167
Right place. Right time.

139
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,583
Wrong truck.

140
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,708
Credit where it's due,
you boys are gangsta.

141
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:19,167
Take another vote,
and then come find me.

142
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:28,500
Thirty thousand views! This
thing's breaking the Internet!

143
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,333
We're gonna get shot.

144
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,500
Right. I'm gettin' tooled up!

145
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,792
Wait, calm down! Sit down!

146
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,667
Sit down. Sit down.

147
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,583
We're rockin' masks
and boiler suits.

148
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,292
No one can know
it's us, can they?

149
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,625
No.

150
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,750
But what about Lotti Mott?

151
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,750
Listen, I don't know about her.

152
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,083
Do I? I've gotta think about it.

153
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,333
You keep your eye on her, Bill.

154
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,375
I can do that.

155
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,333
- Albert?
- Yeah?

156
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,499
Vic's on the blower.

157
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,625
Well, that is all I need,
isn't it?

158
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,999
We did all right last night,
didn't we, boy?

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,417
- Last night?
<i>- The fight, Al.</i>

160
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,999
You got somethin' else
in the hopper, son?

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,851
No, you're right, sorry,
I've... I've had a couple

162
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,792
and I'm celebratin'.
Have a tall one for me.

163
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,917
So what's goin' on?

164
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,292
Saul Gold is goin' on.

165
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,292
Saul Gold the fence?

166
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,333
He's called a job on.

167
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,750
Pick up and drop this afternoon.

168
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,625
Ten grand, son,
C.O.D. We will carve it.

169
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,125
Yeah, today's no good.

170
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,684
The job's booked
and it's good readies.

171
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,083
I understand that, but today
is not a good day, Dad.

172
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,333
Every day is a good day
for a bit of graft, Albert.

173
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,976
Yeah, right. Go on, then. Yeah, I'll do it.
For seven and a half, though.

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,667
You get two and a half
for the booking.

175
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,166
You negotiatin' with me, son?

176
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,832
This is not a negotiation, Dad.

177
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,500
Six for you,
four for me, chop-chop.

178
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,500
There you are, Mrs. Reid,
your order.

179
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:03,542
Lily. It looks
just like his favorite shooter.

180
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,208
You've done us proud.

181
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,708
I'm so sorry for your loss.

182
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,458
John'll love it.

183
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,917
Well... would have.

184
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,292
Just finishing up.
Won't be a minute.

185
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,000
Course...
he would've been balls-deep

186
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:19,875
in all that bullion
hoo-ha, daft sod.

187
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:23,208
Worth millions, I heard. Every face
in the manor is sniffin' about.

188
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:24,999
Bunch of prats.

189
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,167
That much gold's nothing but
a travelcard to the coroner.

190
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,625
Or the clink.

191
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:34,667
Prosperity. Power. Punana.

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,417
Prosperity. Power. Punana.

193
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,917
Sonny? We got company.

194
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:57,417
You have any... idea
what it is to dance

195
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,333
on the steps of Shangri-la?

196
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:11,166
"This town is like a great big
pussy, just waitin' to get fucked!"

197
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,833
"Hoo-hah!"

198
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,833
You think all Cubans
are gangsters?

199
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,292
I got my MBA!

200
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,292
I graduated summa cum laude.

201
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,667
I speak five languages.

202
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,375
I was voted
most likely to succeed.

203
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,042
And succeed you have, my friend.

204
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,458
What do you want, Fink?

205
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,125
I wanna talk...

206
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,083
- about a truck...
- A truck?

207
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:46,542
Sonny, you and I, we got
a good thing goin' here.

208
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,958
This arrangement works well,
I stay in my corner,

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
- you play in yours...
- Get to the fuckin' point.

210
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:09,583
Ambitious.

211
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:12,684
- When and where?
- Five a.m. this morning,

212
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,875
the crossroads behind the strip.

213
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:24,667
A Donmar truck, a little off-the-books
spot, under the arches.

214
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,042
Anything else come to mind?

215
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:31,500
Go away, Fink.
I gotta get my... shuffle on.

216
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:45,833
Our truck takes that route
at 5 a.m. You see somethin'?

217
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,375
I didn't see nothing.

218
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,625
Aah!

219
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,417
Where the fuck is Lotti?

220
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,875
Haven't seen her
since the fight.

221
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,208
Where is that crazy bitch?

222
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,375
Lotti!

223
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,832
I lost my teddy bear.

224
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,143
Can I give you
a hug instead, darling?

225
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,875
Your boss send you
to keep an eye on me?

226
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:11,999
No, two eyes.

227
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,208
And he ain't my boss.

228
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:16,292
You always do what Albert says?

229
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,833
When I fancy the job.

230
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:21,125
I'll get my share of that gold.

231
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,792
One way or another.

232
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,833
Well, I have no idea
what you're talkin' about.

233
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,292
Fancy a ride?

234
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,500
I don't mess around
with the errand boy.

235
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:35,851
I'll be at the gym
on Upper Street

236
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,458
when you change your mind.

237
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,792
Beautiful. Okay. Lean into me.
That's lovely.

238
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:59,458
Yes! My angel, that's... Love
it so, that is gorgeous.

239
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,417
Beautiful, now, yes...

240
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,167
We have a situation,
Master Charles.

241
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,417
Father has misplaced
his Volcano vaporizer?

242
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,917
The whereabouts of a certain
gold fob watch.

243
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:15,708
Gold fob watch?

244
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,750
Lord Cavendish has implied
that I purloined the time piece.

245
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:25,832
After 30 years of loyal appointment, I
have been impeached, Master Charles!

246
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,666
This century English,
please, Staff!

247
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,250
The bugger thinks
I nicked his blood watch,

248
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,333
and unless it's returned...

249
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,125
he's giving me the boot!

250
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:45,167
Well... there... there's been a lot of
break-ins, in the neighborhood recently.

251
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,667
Now, I mean, it's obvious
we've been targeted.

252
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,333
I... I... I may know a man
who might known a man

253
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,667
who might know something.

254
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,625
Leave it with me.

255
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:07,875
Good morning,

256
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,583
Mr. Cavendish-Scott,
how are you?

257
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:12,417
About that watch I brought in the
other day, I need it returned.

258
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,332
It's no longer in stock.
We sold it.

259
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,667
You sold it?

260
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:20,333
How much did it go for?

261
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,458
Decent price... book value.

262
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:25,750
You made out on it, didn't you?

263
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:28,750
Go on, how much?
Couple of grand?

264
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,542
Five?

265
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,875
Ten?

266
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,083
We had a very keen buyer.

267
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,167
Ten grand? You only gave me
a measly 3,000.

268
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,708
What kind of businesswoman
are you?

269
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,667
Okay, well, can you get it back?

270
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,083
I'll see what I can do.

271
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,375
Okay. Good.

272
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,417
Good. Um...

273
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,832
And I was wondering...
I mean, um...

274
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,458
if you've not got any plans
this evening and...

275
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,333
we could...

276
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,667
- What are you doin' here?
- What are you doing here?

277
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,458
I got a sit down with Saul.

278
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,625
Saul Gold? What's the gig?

279
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:18,375
You can go on your way.
Go on, you can jog on now.

280
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:21,042
Yeah, this one's mine.

281
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,083
Okay?

282
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,375
Okay.

283
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:33,332
You pick up my clients,
the Heimels, from the airport,

284
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,667
and you bring 'em back
directly to me.

285
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,208
That's all.
Couldn't be more simple.

286
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,792
How many Heimels
are we expecting, Mr. Gold?

287
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,667
Enough to wipe your ass
when you shit yourelf, bubbeleh.

288
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:43,833
Yeah...

289
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,666
Who cares how many?

290
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:49,999
Just pick 'em up, toss 'em
in the van, bring 'em here.

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,458
- And that's worth ten grand?
- On delivery.

292
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,042
What else are we transportin'
other than the Heimels, Mr. Gold?

293
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:04,542
You're tryin' my patience, boy.

294
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,684
Well, thank you for considerin' us, Mr.
Gold, but with respect,

295
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,583
I'm gonna have
to decline your offer.

296
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,851
If I don't know what I'm transportin',
I cannot guarantee delivery.

297
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,583
You're not like
your old man, are you?

298
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,167
Ol' Vic, he'd be halfway
to Gatwick by now.

299
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,999
Yeah, a lot's changed
since my dad's day, Mr. Gold.

300
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,309
Too many chancers out there lookin'
for a quick score nowadays.

301
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,666
I'm sure you're well aware an armored
truck got rolled, last night,

302
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,500
transport's a risky business.

303
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,832
Diamonds.

304
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,333
A fistful.

305
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,832
Now you in or you out?

306
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,042
- I'm in.
- Splendid.

307
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,375
For 15 grand.

308
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:43,458
- You guarantee delivery?
- Guaranteed.

309
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,667
Van, driver, out the back.
Piss off.

310
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,208
Left. The left, the left,
the left! Left side of the road.

311
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,666
Pardon. This is my first time
driving in the UK.

312
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:01,875
- Really?
- Everything's on the wrong bloody side.

313
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,875
You're a Froggy. Frenchman.

314
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,499
Why... Why... Why are you
the driver?

315
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,625
Uncle Saul wanted a family member...
on the mission.

316
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:23,125
Is that all you got for me,
McLeod? Pig masks and overalls?

317
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,625
Get out!

318
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,875
"Is that all you've got
for me, McLeod?"

319
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:40,250
Well, I've got something
for you all right, darlin'!

320
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,708
You know, my father said to me,
he said, "Son, it don't matter"

321
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:49,333
"if you got a two-inch prick,

322
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,999
"just make sure you hold it like
a baseball bat." You what?

323
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,499
It's all right, McLeod,
Dwyer does that to all the boys.

324
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,750
- Makes us feel, well...
- Like dickless twats?

325
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,875
Like dickless twats.

326
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,000
Ooh. Looks painful.

327
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:16,750
The wee shite trapped my hand
in the truck door.

328
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,851
So is Dwyer gonna set up
an identity parade, then?

329
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,499
She hasn't briefed me yet.

330
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,332
Like I told Dwyer, he was wearin'
a pig mask and overalls.

331
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,958
Did he squeal like a pig?

332
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,332
No. He put on a silly,
wee voice, you know...

333
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:33,166
"No, you bloody well,
don't." Posh, like.

334
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,667
Posh?

335
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,875
So, I take it you got through
customs okay, Mr. Heimel?

336
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:13,833
You guys must really stand out
in those liveries.

337
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:18,458
Yeah, I would've gone with something
a little more... incognito.

338
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Where can we have a little fun
around here?

339
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,208
- Um...
- What kind of fun are you referring to?

340
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,833
Mad fun! Dawg.

341
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,351
Well, you can have
all the mad fun you want

342
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,083
once we've dropped you off
at Saul Gold's.

343
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,417
All work and no play
makes Abel a dull boy.

344
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,083
Turn up the music.

345
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,500
You don't have any more
of those by any chance, do you?

346
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,042
Molly loves you, dawg.

347
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,625
And I love Molly, pal.

348
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:42,332
Where you been hidin',
baby girl?

349
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,000
You're an asshole.
I'm not talkin' to ya.

350
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:49,500
I was thinkin'...
you were right.

351
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,333
Your cut of the takings.

352
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,250
What's the catch?

353
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:01,208
No catch.

354
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,625
You earned it.

355
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,917
A truck got heisted last night.

356
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:25,499
Three banditos, in masks.

357
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Rock and roll.

358
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:33,083
Truck got hit the exact same
time that our truck went out.

359
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,750
On the exact same route.

360
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,792
Maybe they were goin' after your
truck and hit the wrong one.

361
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,000
You're a smart girl, Lotti.

362
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,375
But are you too smart?

363
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:52,500
What are you talkin'
about, Sonny?

364
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,042
Tell me you don't know.

365
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,042
I don't know. All right?

366
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:11,792
Well, if you hear anything...
from around the way...

367
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:14,292
you let me know.

368
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,375
You'll be the first.

369
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,917
Hello, my love.

370
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Hi, darlin'.

371
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,208
What's wrong?

372
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,832
Mrs. Reid not like the wreath?

373
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,500
No, no, she liked it, all right.

374
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,500
You missin' me, then?

375
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,167
Do you know there's gold
on the street, Vic?

376
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:47,333
Armored truck heist.

377
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:52,833
Well, I um...
I did hear a rumor.

378
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:55,833
Just... got me thinking,
it brought up some feelings.

379
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,250
What kind of feelings?

380
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,458
You don't think
it was your gold, do you?

381
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:09,417
Sweetheart...

382
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,832
my gold is long gone.

383
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:15,375
Fifteen years of battles
and bodies have seen to that.

384
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:17,292
How can you know for sure?

385
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,292
Am I hearin' right?

386
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,999
Year after year you been tellin'
me to get it out of my head.

387
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,917
It's taken me 15 years,
Lily, but I've done just that.

388
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:27,083
Now, you want me
thinkin' about it again.

389
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,250
What's gotten into you?

390
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:31,476
That much gold bullion doesn't
crop up on a daily basis

391
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,167
around here, Vic.

392
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,292
It's just... a little bit
close to home, that's all.

393
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,726
Are you saying you want me
to go get it?

394
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,917
No, absolutely not.

395
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:42,375
Because I am stuck
in here, Lily.

396
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,583
How the fuck...
am I gonna get it?

397
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,708
I don't want you to get it.
You're not listening.

398
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,750
I was just... shaken up by hearing
them moan, all their husbands

399
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,750
sniffing about for it.

400
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:56,166
Which husbands?

401
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:57,999
- Who's sniffin'?
- God, Vic,

402
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,768
that's not the point.
It doesn't matter who it was.

403
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,125
I want names.

404
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:03,166
For once can you just
let me talk

405
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:05,167
without making it about you.

406
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:10,958
Domestic, Vic?

407
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:15,167
I'll take that as a yes, then.

408
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,333
He's in there, love.

409
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:42,542
You really this broke?

410
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:44,833
Or you workin'
the "hot struggling fighter"

411
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,167
"livin' in this closet" angle?

412
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,458
I didn't think you messed
around with the help.

413
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,750
Who says I'm messin' around?

414
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:14,042
Charlie, look at your eyes.
What have you done?

415
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:18,666
- Life is a rocky road, Motek.
- Is it?

416
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:21,332
You gotta loosen up your shit.

417
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,375
Boobies!

418
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,167
Don't pull over, Serge.

419
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,667
Pull over or I paint the dash.

420
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,333
I'm pulling over.

421
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,292
You got punked, pussy.

422
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:45,833
I'll keep an eye on them, Al.

423
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,042
Charlie! Charlie, come here!

424
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,500
Sorry, boys.

425
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,417
Saul!

426
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,499
Yeah? Peachy, Mr. Gold,

427
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,875
we'll be with you very shortly.

428
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:02,875
Not you, kid.

429
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:43,666
Mr. Heimel, I'm going to have to insist
we get back on the road immediately.

430
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:47,292
Mr. Gold is waiting for us.
What is your rush, Albert?

431
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:52,167
We're just... blowing off
a little steam!

432
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,332
Charlie, come here.
Charlie, get up!

433
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,750
Charlie...

434
00:28:57,792 --> 00:28:59,559
Excuse me... Can you help
me get these lunatics

435
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:01,833
out of here now!

436
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,917
Have I... Have I ever told you
I love you!

437
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:08,417
- Ey?
- I do. I mean, sometimes

438
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,917
you can be a bit
of a crashing bore,

439
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:14,958
and you have a tendency of being
a little bit controlling.

440
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,500
I... I really do have
very deep feelings for you...

441
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:21,250
Shut up, come on, sit down there.
Sit down, sit down.

442
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:26,375
Come on, Billy, come on, Billy.

443
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:27,833
Come on, Billy,
answer the phone.

444
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:36,792
Shit!

445
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,875
Hey, Boo! What's your sign?

446
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,184
Get out
before I call the bouncer!

447
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,458
I got money to burn, baby girl.

448
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,042
Piss off, kid.

449
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,833
Would a kid have these?

450
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:07,375
Get comfortable.
I'll be right back, baby boy.

451
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,625
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Manny.

452
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,333
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- I've got something for you.

453
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:26,875
Tell Sonny there's
diamonds on the scene.

454
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:47,666
- Mr. Gold?
- Where are my diamonds?

455
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,666
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>
We're just stick in a bit

456
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:50,792
of traffic at the minute,

457
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:51,999
we're on the way
back into town now.

458
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We won't be long, all right?

459
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:54,018
- Albert...
- I'll call you soon.

460
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:55,667
Albert Hill!

461
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:58,958
Fuck me!

462
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,417
Shit.

463
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:21,583
Bomb Squad! Tryin' to get
you outside the back door!

464
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,417
Don't shoot!

465
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:50,208
Allez encule!

466
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,792
Bad dream! Bad dream!

467
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:02,542
Where is my Schmeckel?

468
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:04,542
And where is my diamonds?

469
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,375
Schmeckel!

470
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,417
Go after them!

471
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:28,499
They shot the tires out!

472
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,666
They got the pouch!

473
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,750
- What pouch?
- The bloody stones!

474
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:33,472
- The diamonds?
- Yes, the bloody diamonds!

475
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,476
They've got the diamonds?
How did they get the diamonds?

476
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,792
I thought he had the diamonds!
Yes, the diamonds, you-

477
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,917
- I don't fucking believe this!

478
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:41,958
Shit!

479
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,500
Who... Who were those guys?

480
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:55,667
Dropping pills... in a strip club...
with a bag of diamonds!

481
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,434
Might as well have put out
an advert, Charlie.

482
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:00,875
What matters now
is the stones are gone.

483
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:04,083
Saul... he's gonna
be very pissed.

484
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:06,499
How are we gonna tell Saul
that we lost his stones?

485
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,220
You can tell him
whatever you want, Motek.

486
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,999
I'll be on my way,
back to Brooklyn.

487
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,917
Hey, not a chance. You are coming
with me to Saul to explain

488
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,417
this whole shit show.

489
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:18,833
You took the job
of delivering us to Saul.

490
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,250
You didn't do your job.

491
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:22,833
I'm not taking the fall
for you, Bubba.

492
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,458
I didn't do my job?
I didn't do my job?

493
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,958
I don't remember
a part of this job

494
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,042
where I shoved those Mollys
down your throat!

495
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:32,000
You need to be
a little bit more decisive

496
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:35,667
if you're gonna prosper
in this line of work...

497
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:36,833
Albert.

498
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,666
There you go.
See? You are coming

499
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:46,583
with me to Saul Gold,
and that is final!

500
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:56,083
To the airport, or we'll bleed
you out like a <i>chazzer.</i>

501
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,833
It's a pig.

502
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:09,458
Thanks
for the good times, Bubba.

503
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,500
You ever in Brooklyn,
make sure to look me up.

504
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:21,333
It's been romantic, dawg.

505
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,000
Ha...

506
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:28,500
Sorry, Bubba.
Just... just had to be sure.

507
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:36,583
Peace.

508
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,333
So what now, then?

509
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,417
Lie low in the Costa Del Sol
for a few weeks?

510
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,417
You have got to be shitting me!

511
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:01,875
Who's heisted my diamonds?

512
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,875
I don't know yet, Mr. Gold.

513
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,667
What do you know, boy?

514
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:11,667
Are you okay,
Mr. Cavendish-Scott?

515
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,166
I've had better days, Chloe.

516
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:15,667
And please call me Charlie.

517
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,458
Strip club?

518
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,684
Well, I've got some good news
that might cheer you up, Charlie.

519
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:22,458
You have
a spare bag of diamonds?

520
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,208
I spoke to the man
who bought your watch.

521
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,250
Mollys?

522
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,292
And can you get it back?

523
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,875
For 20,000 I can.

524
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:31,458
Motorbike gang?

525
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,458
Twenty grand? I thought
you sold it for 10.

526
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,375
And resold for 20.
Don't kill the messenger,

527
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:37,833
I can't control
market fluctuation.

528
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,833
Shot my nephew?

529
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:43,375
I don't have 20,000.

530
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,167
Well...

531
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:49,375
do you have access to any
other kind of collateral?

532
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,500
Possibly.

533
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:57,417
Why did I trust the Hill family
with this?

534
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:00,667
Your old man has always
been a liability, and you...

535
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:02,708
you done the family
legacy proud.

536
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,458
Mr. Gold, this is on me,
not my dad.

537
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,042
No, no, no. You made a guarantee.
A guarantee is a guarantee.

538
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,292
It's a famiy affair now, boy.

539
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,958
I want my diamonds back in 48 hours,
or I want their market equivalent,

540
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,583
which is 250 grand,
or I will cut off your cock.

541
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:21,500
I'll put it in a pickle jar.

542
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:23,875
Do you understand me, boy?

543
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:26,832
Yeah, I understand you,
Mr. Gold.

544
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,499
I just thought, you know, if I
got loved up with the Heimels,

545
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,958
I could keep an eye on them.

546
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,434
I thought I was doing
the right thing, Al.

547
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,143
You wouldn't know
the right thing if it kicked you

548
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:36,167
in the bollocks, Charlie.

549
00:36:36,168 --> 00:36:37,393
Well, that's a bit strong, mate.

550
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:38,893
No, I'll tell you
what's a bit strong...

551
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:40,393
Saul Gold threatening
to cut my cock off

552
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:42,667
and stick it in a pickle jar
unless I get him his stones

553
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:45,458
or 250 grand in 48 hours.

554
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,184
So unless you feel like
cashin' in your trust fund

555
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,601
to bail me out,
how are you gonna help me?

556
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,059
You know I don't
have a bloody trust fund!

557
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,323
So how are you gonna help me?

558
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,833
You gonna invite me in
for a drink?

559
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:04,833
You wanna get your brains
blown out?

560
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:09,458
Billy Ayres... hard as nails.

561
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,332
I thought you were leavin'
that prick.

562
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,833
I will... when the time's right.

563
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:19,666
How about I call you tomorrow?

564
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,833
You can keep two eyes on me
all afternoon.

565
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,500
I'll see what I've got on.

566
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:28,542
Don't go spending my gold.

567
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,542
No idea what you're talkin'
about, girl.

568
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,875
You ever seen a diamond
as sweet as that?

569
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:38,917
They're actually sweet, Manny.

570
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:45,167
I'm gonna make me a crown
outta these.

571
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,792
You see, Albert Hill
didn't know what hit him, boss.

572
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:52,083
You did good, man.

573
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,125
Put 'em in the safe.

574
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,208
Gotcha.

575
00:39:03,417 --> 00:39:05,499
Well, this is intriguing.

576
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,999
Back alleys
and illicit meetings.

577
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,042
What have you got
for me, Charlie?

578
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,333
What are you doing?

579
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:13,833
My God.

580
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:19,750
My God!

581
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:21,167
Where did you get these?

582
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,583
If I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

583
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:25,125
What do you want me
to do with them?

584
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:27,292
Sell them,
and get me back my watch.

585
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:30,559
Gold's at a premium right now, I should be
able to get you an excellent valuation.

586
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:33,833
- Yeah, one small hitch.
- Go on.

587
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,417
They're stolen.
Most likely more than once.

588
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,500
So be very careful
who you solicit.

589
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:43,292
And here I thought you guys were just
a couple of small-time hustlers.

590
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,166
Does Albert know about this?

591
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:47,833
Well, I'm growing the operation.

592
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:50,417
Yeah. Big things ahead.

593
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,999
And if you play this right,

594
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
there might be a lot more
where that came from.

595
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:43,833
Posh.

596
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:56,125
<i>Happy New Year, Dad.</i>

597
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:57,375
Take this.

598
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:00,042
Lucky charm.

599
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,542
Fuck.

600
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,167
Dad's gold.
