1
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,958
How much gold is this
Nas Stone fellow looking to buy?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,542
250K sterling.

3
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,018
That should take care
of your immediate problem.

4
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:14,000
- King Royston's boy.
- Yeah.

5
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,166
I haven't seen you
around here in a while.

6
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:17,333
Didn't think I was welcome.

7
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:20,792
Business or pleasure?

8
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,458
Loads of pleasure.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,667
My man!
How you want your skrilla?

10
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,000
Cash.

11
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:28,125
- Who are you?
- I'm Uncle Dean.

12
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:31,625
Looks like you're single, girl.

13
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:34,292
I never could smell
the roses, Mrs. Hill,

14
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,583
but I could always sniff out
a rotten apple.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,458
<i>Well, it all went
according to plan.</i>

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Until it didn't. Yeah.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,125
Yeah, listen, I'm going away
for a very long time, darling.

18
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:00,499
I need you to be tough, Lil.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,666
I need you to be hard as nails.

20
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:07,583
And I need you to do
something very important for me.

21
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:11,333
I want you to send
a smoke signal

22
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:14,958
to every firm on the plot.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,375
You tell them there's
bent cops on the streets

24
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:20,375
with gold.

25
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:22,250
Shit loads of gold.

26
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,332
You tell them finders keepers.

27
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,333
You tell them I don't care.

28
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:31,499
I don't care who gets the gold.

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,666
So long...

30
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,332
as it's not...

31
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,333
Bob Fink.

32
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,625
Bingo.

33
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:41,684
Give us a minute,
would you, Charlie?

34
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,083
Who is that lump, Al?

35
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,375
You don't wanna know.

36
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,417
Patsy.

37
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,542
So what's it gonna be, Albert?

38
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,875
The bolt cutters
or a happy ending?

39
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:02,792
Here you are.

40
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,417
It's all there.
It's all accounted for.

41
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:08,166
Every last bean.

42
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,083
So we good?

43
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:14,417
Skin of your teeth, son.

44
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,458
Now don't forget,

45
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,333
if you ever need a stop gap,
you got my digits, boy.

46
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,208
First stop, take a little
trip to Saul Gold.

47
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,667
Get him off my case.

48
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,167
Yeah, the best place
for your cock

49
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,999
might have been that pickle jar.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,499
And what is that
supposed to mean?

51
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,832
No, just kidding, Al.

52
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,499
You know, sense of humor
and all that.

53
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,726
Yeah, well, I fail to see
the funny in that

54
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,792
actually, Charlie.

55
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:44,792
Mum?

56
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:48,167
Mum!

57
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,208
- No, no, no, no!
- This cannot be happening!

58
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,976
- Where's the gold, Al?
- Give me a second, Charlie.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,708
- All right?
- Where is it?!

60
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,351
How are we gonna fix this
unmitigated fucking disaster?!

61
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,958
Will you shut up?!

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,542
Charlie, give us
a minute, please.

63
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,167
Of course, Mrs. H, yeah.

64
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,667
When were you planning
on telling me?

65
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:19,708
I didn't want
to worry you, did I?

66
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,292
It's a bit late for that.

67
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,667
Talk.

68
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,332
On fight night,
we went after Castillo,

69
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,292
but we hit the wrong truck.

70
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,250
The truck we did hit
was transporting the gold.

71
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:38,833
Who's gold is it, Albert?

72
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,500
I don't know.

73
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:44,667
But it's got
the same stamp as Dad.

74
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,625
This bloody gold.

75
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,333
Bloody, bloody family!

76
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,332
Leave it now,
it's gone now, leave it!

77
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,875
Bob Fink was here yesterday
asking about dad.

78
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:58,500
Asking about you, Albert.

79
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:01,000
Bob Fink was in here?

80
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,832
Did he do this, Mum?

81
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,750
That would be my guess, yes.

82
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:09,000
He didn't find the gold, though.

83
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,958
So where is it?

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,458
I should've thrown it
in the bloody river.

85
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,708
Mum, where is it?

86
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,167
I moved it down the market
to Father John's.

87
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:26,458
You beauty. Come on, Charlie.

88
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,833
You got plans?

89
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:50,667
Maybe.

90
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,667
Maybe what?

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,625
Who's to say we got
those diamonds back?

92
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,708
- Maybe...
- Mwah.

93
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,143
We could take
a long ride together.

94
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,667
Mwah.

95
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:12,458
Get out of this shithole.

96
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,333
Nothing holding us down,
nothing holding us back.

97
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,833
Live life on the move.

98
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,875
Freedom.

99
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:35,083
Keep the stones.

100
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,792
Leave the others with the gold.

101
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,708
Fair trade, if you ask me.

102
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,208
I've been best mates
with Al for 20 years.

103
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,833
You think I'll bail on him

104
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:55,167
for a half-decent
pair of tits like you?

105
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,750
Half-decent?

106
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,833
Best tits you ever
copped hold of.

107
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,375
I had to keep an eye on you

108
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:03,000
while Castillo
was still a threat.

109
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:05,000
Now it's done.

110
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:06,625
You kicking me out?

111
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,332
I've got nowhere to go,
you asshole!

112
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,083
You're a smart girl!

113
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,292
You'll work something out.

114
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,958
Yeah, too smart

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,393
to be with a cupboard
squatter like you.

116
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:18,832
Moving on?

117
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,875
Moving on.

118
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,875
- No.
- Yes.

119
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,208
- No!
- Yes!

120
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,375
No, how did you
pull that off, Billy?

121
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:37,333
Well, four Pikeys
walk into a pub...

122
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,332
Yes. What about Castillo?

123
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,542
There is no Castillo, Al.

124
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,208
What about Norman?

125
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:47,332
He still got a pulse?

126
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,999
Barely!

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,351
They dropped him off
at your mum's.

128
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,875
My mum's, why?

129
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,393
We couldn't exactly
take him to the hospital

130
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:54,601
with fragments of safe
decorating his face,

131
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,792
now could we?

132
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:59,083
All right, fair enough.

133
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,042
Bob Fink's messed the shop up.

134
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,417
Bob Fink?

135
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,726
Reckon he was looking
for the gold.

136
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,417
How did that turncoat
get onto us?

137
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,542
I have absolutely no idea.

138
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,917
Yeah.

139
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,917
That one...

140
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,750
might... might just be on me.

141
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:18,999
The video.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,833
My bloody slippers.

143
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,750
Slippers?

144
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,875
Make some sense, Charlie.

145
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:27,167
Fink cornered me the other day.

146
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,875
Ooh!

147
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,726
Spouting some nonsense
about seeing my slippers

148
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,958
on the heist video.

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,499
What?

150
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,958
And you told him what exactly?

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,417
I didn't say a word.

152
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,875
Okay, he got nothing from me.

153
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:45,417
You might as well
have worn a badge

154
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,583
with your name on it.

155
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,042
You should've told me
about this, Charlie.

156
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,458
We could have avoided
this problem.

157
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,417
Well, I messed up.

158
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,042
Okay, I'm sorry, guys.

159
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,934
It's not like I'm a seasoned
armed robber, is it?

160
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,333
No, you're not.

161
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,750
Now I've burned the bloody eggs.

162
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,351
I'm gonna get these back
to Saul Gold.

163
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,875
Ooh, yeah, wait for me, Al.

164
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,875
This better blow
my wig back, boy.

165
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,500
The inventory's accounted for.

166
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:34,917
So we're done?

167
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,292
Don't get all puffed up

168
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,125
because you fixed
your own screw-up.

169
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:42,833
Your father, poor bastard,
can rest a little easier now.

170
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,667
Now, listen good.

171
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,833
I've got a pickup down
by the railyard,

172
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,542
and I need two boys.

173
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,792
Couldn't be simpler.

174
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,083
I've got a Sheikh
with more money

175
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,625
than a horse has hair.

176
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,708
He needs a wedding gift
for his new wife.

177
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,875
What kind of a wedding gift?

178
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:12,417
I don't know yet, but I've
set up a meeting to find out.

179
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,833
Lovely, so what you need
me to do?

180
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,542
It's what Charlie
Cavendish-Scott can do.

181
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,333
Do tell.

182
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,083
So Sheikh Zeshan studied
at Oxford University.

183
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,875
He'll be used to a...

184
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:29,999
certain type of Englishman.

185
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,167
Country estates
not council estates, I get it.

186
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,542
Let's pay your Sheikh a visit.

187
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,500
Let's put him into
a gold state of mind.

188
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,833
I heard the good news.

189
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,166
All sorted with Saul.

190
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,750
Told you I'd sort it, didn't I?

191
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,518
And sort it you did
my boy, and sort it you did.

192
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:14,499
Mwah!

193
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,375
You're chipper.

194
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,458
What happen, you win the bingo?

195
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,166
Well, you know,
a stretch in the hole

196
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:23,750
gives one time to reflect
upon life's priorities.

197
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:24,833
The hole?

198
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,333
Come on, what did you do?

199
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:28,166
No, the prison therapist
calls the hole

200
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:30,708
a metaphor
for my emotional condition.

201
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,875
If, perish the thought,
you'd visit me

202
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,518
a little more often
these past few months,

203
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:35,893
you'd be more acquainted
with what your old man's

204
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,833
been going through.

205
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,143
I've terribly sorry, Dad.
Why don't you tell me?

206
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:40,542
What have you
been going through?

207
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,417
Well... I've had visions, son.

208
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,833
Visions of the past.

209
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,542
Visions of the future.

210
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,417
Visions of how things should be.

211
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,667
What's the skinny
on the truck heist?

212
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:07,083
The gold bullion?

213
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,750
Don't know, the street
went dark on that one.

214
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:12,625
But you've seen
the video, haven't you?

215
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,458
Yeah, of course I have.
Who hasn't?

216
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,458
It really reminded me...

217
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,583
the way they robbed
that truck...

218
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:25,083
of...

219
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,583
me!

220
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,167
Although, it does
lack a certain finesse.

221
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,167
All brass bollocks

222
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,208
and no brains.

223
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,667
So what's the plan
with the winnings?

224
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,643
What are you gonna do with it
on the inside, anyway?

225
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:46,125
There is no inside.

226
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:49,666
No walls.

227
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,125
None that matter, anyway.

228
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,708
You look tired, son.

229
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,750
Get some rest.

230
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:23,000
Do you trust Father John
with our gold, Al?

231
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:26,166
I don't trust anyone
with that gold, Billy.

232
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:27,625
Until we can move it,

233
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,500
better the devil we know?

234
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,458
Comes from the Lord!

235
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,792
He who keeps you
will not slumber.

236
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,917
The Lord will keep you
from all evil.

237
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,542
Amen.

238
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:50,250
- You get all that, Billy-Boy?
- I'm born again, Al.

239
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:53,500
In the house of Father John.

240
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,375
Albert Hill.

241
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,875
Give him praise.
Give him adoration.

242
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:01,500
So it appears you have
inherited your father's

243
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,833
spirit for adventure.

244
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,208
Something like that,
Father John.

245
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:06,958
Life's either a great adventure

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,333
or nothing at all, my son.

247
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,999
I have a parish project

248
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,083
I'd like to discuss with you.

249
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,042
Give whatever you can give.

250
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,625
Reach in your pocket and...

251
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,625
Are you looking
for redemption, mate?

252
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,500
Redemption? Before lunch?

253
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:37,083
Your path begins here, brother.

254
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,542
With Father John.

255
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,999
For a tenner.

256
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Cheap at half the price.

257
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,208
Keeps the Devil from your door.

258
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,417
Speak of the Devil

259
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,042
and his horns shall appear!

260
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,125
Put one of those on ice for me.

261
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,332
I trust attendance is good
at the moment, Father John?

262
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,875
Yeah, well, there are
many lost souls in need

263
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:23,333
of the Lord's protection
in these most troubled of times.

264
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,500
So what's the price to keep
my commodity safe and sound?

265
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,166
That depends on the value
of the commodity

266
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,333
and its exposure.

267
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:39,750
Two million views.

268
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,458
The Internet is
a marvel of communication,

269
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,042
is it not, Albert?

270
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,833
So what's this gonna run me?

271
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,333
Well, the mission is
in desperate need of repair.

272
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,292
I've been quoted 50,000
for a new roof.

273
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,666
A fair contribution
for the work involved.

274
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:00,542
And what insurance do I get
for this contribution?

275
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,375
Security's tighter than
Fort Knox's asshole, son.

276
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,458
50 grand to a bent priest?

277
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,583
Mate, I thought we were the ones

278
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,101
supposed to be making good
off the gold.

279
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,226
We just gotta find a buyer.

280
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,875
Charlie, where are you?

281
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:34,167
<i>- I'm at the hotel.</i>
- Chloe there?

282
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,000
Right by my side.

283
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:39,082
Come over to the houseboat
as soon as you're done.

284
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,666
I gotta take care of something.

285
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,833
Billy Ayers getting attached.

286
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:50,042
Behave yourself, soppy bollocks.

287
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,875
You don't think I'm
overselling it, do you?

288
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:06,958
No.

289
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,375
One thing to bear in mind,
the Sheikhs are super fickle.

290
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:13,000
A year back, Saul spent weeks
trying to fix a deal.

291
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:15,750
Only to lose it by calling
one of them sir.

292
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:17,792
Well, what should he
have called him?

293
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,333
Sheikh, Charlie.

294
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,833
Their title is Sheikh.

295
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,833
Once we're done
with these Sheikhs,

296
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,250
um, maybe you and I...

297
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,833
Lord Cavendish and Chloe Koen

298
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,958
here to see Sheikh Zeshan.

299
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,500
I like these Sheikhs.

300
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,666
What's this? Who are you?

301
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:05,999
Sheikh Zeshan, Chloe Koen.
Pleased to meet you.

302
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,332
Please may I present
Lord Charles Cavendish.

303
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,667
At your service, Sheikh.

304
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,167
So what do you have for me?

305
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,417
More necklaces? Tiaras?

306
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,500
Not another damn Faberge egg.

307
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,958
Better.

308
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,083
Lord Cavendish
has a large holding

309
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,083
of exquisite, one-of-a-kind
gold artifacts.

310
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,708
I have palaces
full of gold artifacts!

311
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,417
I'm getting married
in a few months,

312
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,250
and the princess is not
easily impressed.

313
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:40,000
I need something, um...
unexpected.

314
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,832
I know exactly what you mean.

315
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:47,000
Lord Cavendish has
just the thing.

316
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,042
Yes, I do.

317
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,667
Wh... wh... which one
of my many artifacts

318
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:56,333
did you have
specifically in mind?

319
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,625
The... solid...

320
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:01,917
24... karat gold...

321
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,417
bathtub.

322
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,917
Imagine it.

323
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,000
Your fiancée.

324
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:17,250
A soapy lather.

325
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:20,833
That unmistakable glint.

326
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,000
Bathing in gold

327
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:25,999
every night.

328
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,333
A glimmer of pure opulence.

329
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,333
Enriching the man

330
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,000
who slips in beside her.

331
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,832
I want one.

332
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,667
What?! You don't have one?!

333
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,625
Of course we have one, Sheikh.

334
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,833
When is delivery?

335
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,166
We fly out to Dubai
tomorrow night.

336
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:51,458
The price is
10 million pounds sterling.

337
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,458
Blah blah, I like it!
I'll buy it.

338
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,875
Well, you won't be
disappointed, sir...

339
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:58,500
Sheikh Ze... Zash... Zee...

340
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:00,792
4:00pm tomorrow,
we'll be in touch

341
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,917
about the location, and your men

342
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,583
can pick up the bath.

343
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:08,333
Thank you so much,
Sheikh Zeshan.

344
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:25,458
Throw another log
on for me, love.

345
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,332
Nice day at the beach, darling?

346
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
the water was lovely and warm.

347
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,667
Now... now listen,
before you react,

348
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,750
just take a moment.

349
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:38,333
What have you done, Vic?

350
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,083
I hit a screw.

351
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,875
I don't know why!

352
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:48,500
You selfish bastard.

353
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:50,708
You had three months left.

354
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,208
You'll have another 18 months
on your sentence.

355
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,643
I've done enough time
in here, Lil.

356
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:55,667
I can't do anymore.

357
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,667
No, Vic, no.

358
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,500
Don't you try it.
Don't you dare.

359
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:01,976
The wheels are in motion.
Gotta go.

360
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,708
- Vic.
<i>- I gotta go, luv.</i>

361
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,000
Vic!

362
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,000
It's time.

363
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,333
I'm gonna fly the nest.

364
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,500
Should we use the same lab
up in Chelmsford?

365
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,917
Nasty zombie meths up there.

366
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,875
Them boys were chewing
their faces off.

367
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:23,167
Heh. The nastier, the better.

368
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,417
Yeah.

369
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,917
Done deal.

370
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,875
We deliver to the Sheikh
tomorrow afternoon.

371
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,832
Tomorrow... Slow down.
How much does he want?

372
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,125
All of it. He wants all of it!

373
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,666
A ten-million-pound
gold wedding gift.

374
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:48,083
I mean, money is just
no object to this guy.

375
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,792
So all the gold gone
in one fell swoop?

376
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,167
Ten million quid?
Simple as that?

377
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,000
Well, there is one small catch.

378
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:58,208
- What catch?
- Yeah.

379
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,458
We have to smelt it first.

380
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,208
Smelt it? Into what?

381
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,458
- A bathtub.
- A solid gold bathtub.

382
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,000
And how we supposed to do that?

383
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:09,208
Jesus, Al.
We don't have all the answers.

384
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,000
Well?

385
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,832
What do you want?

386
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,375
I dunno.

387
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,083
I guess I just wanted
to sort things out

388
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,458
after this morning.

389
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,625
Nothing to sort out.

390
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:35,166
We're moving on, right?

391
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:38,875
Oi, here's the thing.

392
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:41,667
I'm not the boyfriend type.

393
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,917
I'd be a shit boyfriend
'cause...

394
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,583
I've never actually been one.

395
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,042
What are you talking about?

396
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,518
You know, the guy you call
every day,

397
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:52,000
the guy you spend
all your time with.

398
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:54,333
That guy isn't me.

399
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,332
I just wasn't made that way.

400
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,832
What, and you think I am?

401
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:01,000
Sonny Castillo is dead
in a dumpster.

402
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:03,999
I'm not the settling down
type either.

403
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,458
I just wanted to get away
from all this shit.

404
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,292
And you were the closest guy
with a six-pack,

405
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,999
a motorbike,
and a bag of diamonds.

406
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,500
So, we good?

407
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,125
Good, bad.
Who gives a shit, right?

408
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,417
Yeah.

409
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,458
Who gives a shit?

410
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,833
So... what's with the big rush?

411
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,083
We've got a buyer lined up
for tomorrow afternoon.

412
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:38,917
Your traveler mates,
they know how to smelt gold?

413
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,208
Yeah, Uncle Dean.

414
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,208
He'll be the man for the job.

415
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,292
Why are we
smelting gold exactly?

416
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,792
We need to make a gold bath.

417
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:50,333
A gold bath?

418
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,125
A gold bath?

419
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:57,000
- Yeah.
- Well...

420
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,417
I made a gold shitter once.

421
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,292
So can you do it?

422
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,917
Can you make a gold bathtub?

423
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,667
Aye.

424
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,042
I'll give it a crack.

425
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,083
Ladies and gentlemen,

426
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,958
ready for the main event.

427
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,708
Contrary to popular belief,

428
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,250
the majority of Travelers
are well-heeled,

429
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,375
hard-working citizens.

430
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:25,667
True, we enjoy
an alternative lifestyle.

431
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:29,167
Attempting to evade
the punitive taxes

432
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:33,375
that a hostile government
imposes upon us.

433
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:36,083
But never forget

434
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,458
you are amidst

435
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,167
the greatest craftsmen

436
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,250
you have ever seen!

437
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,042
You sure about this, Al?

438
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,125
I am far from sure
about this, Charlie.

439
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:21,333
Horse shit and wood ash.

440
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:22,958
Nature's crucible.

441
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,708
Sure, it has to withstand
temperatures

442
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,667
of 1,950 degrees Fahrenheit.

443
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:29,625
I have the young'uns on the job,

444
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:32,000
bringing it to the boil.

445
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,250
In our little community,

446
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:39,042
when there's a job worth doing,

447
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,417
we all muck in.

448
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,375
So... start digging,

449
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:46,833
ya ballicks!

450
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:04,292
The girls have fashioned you
a beautiful bath

451
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,708
made entirely from wax.

452
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,833
Won't it melt?

453
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,708
That's the whole idea, darlin'.

454
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,042
Lost wax casting.

455
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,125
It's in the name.

456
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,917
Come on, girls!

457
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,875
Hey!

458
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:39,332
Time is a 'wasting!

459
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,499
Ready to pour?

460
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,750
Ready so.

461
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,000
Alchemists and metallurgists

462
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:46,500
have been in our family
for generations.

463
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:49,125
Millennia.

464
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:51,000
We have taken our skills

465
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,833
east to China,

466
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,250
south to Egypt,

467
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:58,250
and all across
the Holy Roman Empire

468
00:26:58,292 --> 00:27:00,041
until this place

469
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:02,542
at this time.

470
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:05,167
But never...

471
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:08,083
has an outsider

472
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:09,333
been witness to our magic.

473
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:20,166
Tonight, tis your honor

474
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,166
to pop the cherry.

475
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:23,167
Pop whose cherry?

476
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:36,208
One clean strike.

477
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:21,708
So... what happens now?

478
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,458
Well... now...

479
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,792
we get twatted.

480
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,333
'Cause there's nothing
we can do till the morning.

481
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,833
It's a painful proposition

482
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,875
being human.

483
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:09,500
From the moment
we leave the womb...

484
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:16,167
we're at the mercy
of the oppressors...

485
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:19,292
the lecherous...

486
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,333
the inhumane.

487
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:29,250
It's a wonder...

488
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:32,583
a miracle really...

489
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,583
that one ever achieves

490
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,625
any peace at all.

491
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:43,458
Eat up, boys.
We're here all night.

492
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,667
All right, so let's...

493
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:52,832
open her up,
take her clothes off,

494
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,750
and see her naked.

495
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:57,042
Whoa!

496
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:12,750
And come on!

497
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:16,958
Aah!

498
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:48,542
Sheikh's here, Charlie.

499
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:50,125
Okay.

500
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:52,167
Okay, stay calm.

501
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:06,042
Hello, Sheikh Zeshan.

502
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:11,708
Why did we have to come here?

503
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,917
No showroom?

504
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,332
For such a high-priced item,

505
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,999
we deliver on-site
for insurance purposes.

506
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,417
I have a plane to catch.
Where is this bath?

507
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,792
I'll have it brought
around now, Sheikh.

508
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,333
We're on.

509
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:40,875
Where the hell is it?!

510
00:31:40,917 --> 00:31:43,417
I should have just
bought her another yacht.

511
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,500
Here it is now, Sheikh.

512
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,750
Who are these two?

513
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:55,708
Th... Th... These are just
my delivery men, Sheikh.

514
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,125
I like it.

515
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:19,500
It's unique.

516
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:22,042
Does the bird come
with the bath?

517
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,458
What did you say?

518
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,375
What is this?

519
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,500
I'm a mediator.

520
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:47,208
Engaged to make sure
all parties are satisfied.

521
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:49,833
Nothing to be
concerned about, Sheikh.

522
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:54,417
Shall we, complete
the, transaction, Sheikh?

523
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,499
This is a lot of force
for a bathroom fixture.

524
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,166
Bathroom fixture?

525
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:02,332
This is a 24-karat,
handmade gold bath, mate.

526
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,875
With all due respect, Sheikh,

527
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:07,375
this is an exquisite piece.

528
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:10,042
As my assistant here
plainly pointed out,

529
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:11,792
this is a 24-karat bath.

530
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,167
A collector's item.

531
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:16,917
Handmade by the finest artisans.

532
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:24,708
Well, there are other...

533
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,833
people interested.

534
00:33:32,792 --> 00:33:34,542
I'll take it, I'll take it.

535
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,417
If you could transfer
the agreed funds...

536
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:40,250
- Ring it up.
- Okay.

537
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:45,167
- Yes, 2-5-3-6-7-1...
- Zero.

538
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:47,917
- 6...
- Zero zero.

539
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:51,708
Albert Hill!

540
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,125
You've been a naughty boy.

541
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,375
Yalla, let's go, let's go!

542
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:04,208
No, no, no, no, no! Shit!

543
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,667
Up and at 'em, boys!

544
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:26,167
Fink!

545
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:38,292
Well, come on then!

546
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,499
Chloe!

547
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Don't you touch her!

548
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:24,500
Aah!

549
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:32,167
Whoa!

550
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:53,958
Are you prepare to shoot
a man of the cloth

551
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,667
for material gains?

552
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:58,250
Yeah.

553
00:35:58,292 --> 00:36:00,625
In a heartbeat.

554
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,833
Get in!

555
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:16,167
Go, go, go, go, go!

556
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:23,917
Fuck!

557
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:25,792
Fuck!

558
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,667
We need to get out of town.
There's way too much heat.

559
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:45,792
My family's place
in the country.

560
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,625
Straight up the M1,
it's perfect.

561
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:48,999
Well, I hope
it's comfy, Charlie,

562
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
'cause we might be there
for a while.

563
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,333
Aah!

564
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,667
Aah!

565
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:29,833
To the brim?

566
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,499
Everything okay?

567
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,083
Yes, Norman, fine.

568
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:38,166
Thinking about Vic?

569
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:41,500
Amongst other things.

570
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:44,332
So... he's on the countdown.

571
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,042
Three months and he's home...

572
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,245
I don't know, Norman.
What's with all the questions?

573
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:52,167
You worried gonna have to start
cooking for yourself again?

574
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:59,875
Sorry, that was a little strong.

575
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,875
While I was convalescing,

576
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:07,000
I was remembering the times
you'd cook me and Vic

577
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:09,458
a fry-up after a job.

578
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,542
Always at some ungodly hour.

579
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,417
We'd polish off a bottle or two.

580
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,000
Vic would be snoring
on the sofa, and...

581
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,958
you and I would talk and...

582
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,999
and giggle till it got light.

583
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,708
Having a laugh.

584
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,167
Yeah, they were
good times, Norman.

585
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:31,833
For all of us.

586
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:37,500
Who is it?

587
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,750
Police!

588
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:40,750
Open up
or we'll put the door in.

589
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:42,792
No need for that.

590
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:49,125
Lily Hill, you alone?

591
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,832
Firstly, you know
exactly who I am,

592
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:59,499
and secondly,
of course I'm on my own.

593
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,667
You put my husband behind bars.

594
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:03,167
We have reason to believe

595
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,166
you're in possession
of illegal firearms.

596
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:07,542
Up to your old tricks
again, Bob?

597
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,333
Oi, be careful with my things!

598
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:17,417
Come on!

599
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:41,000
- Find anything?
- Nothing here, sir.

600
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:42,666
All right, well, check in there.

601
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:46,125
- Done, checked, it's...
- Check again.

602
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,500
Sir!

603
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:08,167
I found something.

604
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:11,500
For Christ sakes!

605
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,167
Lily Hill, I'm arresting you

606
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:14,809
on suspicion of possessing
Prohibited Weapons

607
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:17,832
defined by Section Five
of the Firearms Act, 1968,

608
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,208
You do not have to say anything,

609
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,667
but it may it harm your defense

610
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,208
if you do not mention
my questioned

611
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,726
something which you later
rely on in court.

612
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,332
Anything you do say may be
given in evidence.

613
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,667
All right?

614
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:33,999
Off we go. Two pair.

615
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,333
- Full house.
- Mmph!

616
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:38,250
- Deal me again.
- Right, why, you up?

617
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:40,458
Can I get involved?

618
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,375
There is a minimum stake.

619
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:46,417
Will these do?

620
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,958
White chocolate.

621
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,375
My favorite.

622
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:57,792
Nice bit of shopping, Smudger.

623
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,375
That's for you.

624
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,333
I can smell the fresh air
already, Vic.

625
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,542
- Good boy.
- Cheers, Mr. H.

626
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:10,708
Whose house did you say
this was again, Charlie?

627
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:12,375
My cousin Monty.

628
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:14,833
Where exactly is Cousin Monty?

629
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:16,625
Zurich, last I heard.

630
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,958
Might have run a bit afoul
with the Inland Revenue.

631
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,292
Naughty, naughty Cousin Monty.

632
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:36,083
In we go.

633
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:40,833
They leave the keys to this
place under the plant pot?

634
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,167
You know, rich people shit.
