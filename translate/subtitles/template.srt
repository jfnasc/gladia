1
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:32,509
Get... get back in the truck!

2
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:33,783
Get back in the truck!

3
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:37,204
Hey, dispatch?

4
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:38,906
We have an emergency situation...

5
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,441
You hear that?

6
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:46,213
<i>Copy that. Stand by.</i>

7
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,217
Somebody got shot.

8
00:00:50,252 --> 00:00:51,685
Officer Beck to headquarters. I...

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,454
Headquarters, shots fired, shots fired.

10
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:55,946
I need some units.
Shots fired, I need some units.

11
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:57,191
Shots fired.

12
00:00:57,225 --> 00:01:01,061
<i>All units, all units
respond to Graham and Spring.</i>

13
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:04,164
Damn!

14
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:08,302
Back, back!

15
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,041
- Got him covered?
- I got him covered.

16
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,447
Move it, move back.

17
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,584
Stay back.

18
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,321
Get out of the way.

19
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:29,490
Move it.

20
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:30,391
Stay behind the line.

21
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:37,564
Stay behind the tape.

22
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,699
Back up.

23
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:41,101
Back up.

24
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:43,737
Hey, get back. I said back up.

25
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,172
Payback's a bitch.

27
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:24,916
<i>Bottom of the ninth inning, two outs.</i>

28
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:26,947
<i>Tying run on second base.</i>

29
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:28,682
<i>Yale's down 1-nothing.</i>

30
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:30,609
<i>Terry has a walk and a double,</i>

31
00:02:30,695 --> 00:02:32,886
<i>but is now looking at an 0-2 count.</i>

32
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:34,913
<i>He steps to the plate.</i>

33
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:37,091
<i>Wow, what is Terry doing?</i>

34
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,026
<i>That is some serious trash-talking.</i>

35
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,362
<i>Crowd doesn't like it.
Not sure I do, either.</i>

36
00:02:41,396 --> 00:02:42,429
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

37
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:46,694
<i>Folks, that is high, that is deep,
that is out of here!</i>

38
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,402
<i>Home run!</i>

39
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:52,873
- What do you see, Ruiz?
- An arrogant ass.

40
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:54,508
Is that accurate?

41
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,010
Not entirely, sir.

42
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:58,679
So why go Babe Ruth?

43
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:00,881
Well, because once
you tell someone how bad

44
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:03,584
you're about to screw them,
you have to come through.

45
00:03:06,323 --> 00:03:08,604
There's been a police shooting
of an unarmed man today.

46
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:10,557
Gate Station, North Carolina.

47
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:13,360
Governor called me personally.

48
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:15,798
She wants the DOJ
to handle the investigation.

49
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:17,798
She doesn't want another Ferguson.

50
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:20,567
It's a black cop and a white kid.

51
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,645
Ruiz is going to run it,

52
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,693
but she wants a black prosecutor
out front; optics.

53
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:30,132
This climate, only a black man
can indict this black cop

54
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:33,009
without inciting tensions.
If he's guilty.

55
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:36,383
I've been through a stack of résumés,

56
00:03:36,418 --> 00:03:37,851
and you guys all look the same.

57
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:39,920
First in your class at an Ivy.

58
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,889
Law review. All closers.

59
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:46,026
What I need is a cleaner.

60
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:48,695
I need that guy

61
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,231
who points to the fence
with two strikes on him.

62
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,733
He's barely a year out of law school.

63
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:54,835
That's just math, sir.

64
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:56,437
My recent work on
the Wynn case proved it.

65
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:58,238
I took over arguments
and got three indictments.

66
00:03:58,273 --> 00:04:01,341
The team got three indictments.

67
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:03,377
Yes, the team.

68
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:04,478
What about those optics?

69
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:05,946
All I care about is the truth.

70
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,315
And my truth has no color.

71
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,817
That's a lovely naiveté.

72
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:10,717
Thank you.

73
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:11,819
That wasn't praise.

74
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:19,406
Our own Attorney General
said that the biggest challenge

75
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:22,680
for all of us in this office
is not only to represent

76
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:25,866
and enforce the law,
but to use it to make real

77
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,500
the promise of America,
the promise of fairness

78
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,305
and equality.

79
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:33,440
Is she naive, sir?

80
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:39,179
Because if so, I'm happy
to wear that badge with her.

81
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:51,692
Uh-oh, what you got?

82
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:54,194
Eh, eh, eh. Seven, eight...

83
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:56,063
bam!

84
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:59,066
Oh, lucky!

85
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,534
Hey, what's that on your face?

86
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:03,337
What's that on your face?

87
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:14,381
Listen, Boogs,

88
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,983
Mommy has to go out of town for work.

89
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:17,484
For how long this time?

90
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,954
I don't know, but, uh,
we're going to Face Chat

91
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,489
every morning and every night, okay?

92
00:05:22,524 --> 00:05:26,193
Even though that face will
probably break my computer.

93
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:28,729
Well, I get my looks from you.

94
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,531
- Oh!
- Hey, Kai.

95
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:32,921
- It's time for bed.
- What?

96
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:34,514
No.

97
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:37,504
Hey, Paula, we're good.
We're just gonna play one more game.

98
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:39,623
Her bedtime is 8:30.

99
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:43,310
We can make an exception tonight.

100
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,473
Look, you're not the one
who has to drag her

101
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,848
out of bed in the morning
and get her to school on time.

102
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:49,049
I'm not even sleepy, yet.

103
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,451
Kai, start your night routine, now!

104
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:57,758
It's okay, Boogs... Mommy loves you.

105
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:58,892
Mmm, I love you, I love you.

106
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:02,663
Good night.

107
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,537
Raise your voice
in front of my kid again

108
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:12,369
and I'll give you
a hysterectomy with my fist.

109
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:15,309
Hey, hey, hey, what's happening?

110
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,278
Get off me!

111
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:20,480
What the hell, Ashe?

112
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:23,283
She's a child, Javi,
trying to play house.

113
00:06:23,318 --> 00:06:26,153
Kai has a mother... remind her of that.

114
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:27,321
By throwing a vase at her head?

115
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:28,655
I threw it by her head.

116
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:34,661
- You need to see somebody.
- I am.

117
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:36,330
- I'm serious.
- I will.

118
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:37,998
I can't have this craziness.

119
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:39,499
You used to like crazy.

120
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:41,835
Yeah, but then we had a kid.

121
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:46,373
So you go get yourself wifey material.

122
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,840
With the apron and dinner waiting
for you when you get home.

123
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:52,256
We both know you're bored as hell.

124
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,451
Does she know what you're really like?

125
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:57,584
How you like it?

126
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:02,923
Does she know when you're with
her, I'm inside your head?

127
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:11,064
I got to go check on my daughter.

128
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:16,406
Tell her... tell her
I'm gonna call her tomorrow.

129
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:28,709
<i>Second in touchdowns.</i>

130
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:30,147
<i>Mace, what-what's up with that?</i>

131
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:32,052
<i>Are you starting to get
a little tired inside the 20?</i>

132
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:37,991
- So you're their boy.
- Excuse me?

133
00:07:38,026 --> 00:07:41,395
I'm Ashe Akino... your investigator.

134
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:43,163
Preston Terry, your boss.

135
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,698
Interim, right?

136
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:47,668
Ruiz is just tying up some
loose ends on another case?

137
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:50,003
Yeah, he'll be done in about a week.

138
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:52,739
I know Ruiz, but what's your steelo?

139
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:54,340
How aggressive I go is up to you.

140
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:56,810
Do your job the right way...
by the book.

141
00:07:56,844 --> 00:08:00,013
Job the right way... you got it.

142
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:01,670
Boss.

143
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:05,919
<i>Welcome to North Carolina.</i>

144
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,021
<i>For those of you boarding
flights to Chicago...</i>

145
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:14,461
Preston Terry?

146
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,962
- Yes?
- Hi.

147
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:17,664
I'm Sarah Ellis,
aide to Governor Eamons.

148
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,304
Welcome to North Carolina.

149
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:20,890
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

150
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:22,636
- Ashe Akino.
- My investigator.

151
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,539
Well, I'm sure you're eager
to hit the ground running.

152
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,007
The governor's just hoping
to have a quick word with you.

153
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,498
Of course.

154
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,278
<i>I wish you were here</i>

155
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:33,613
under better circumstances,
but I do hope

156
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:36,450
you'll get a feel for
our Southern hospitality.

157
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:38,129
Born and raised in Virginia, ma'am.

158
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:39,853
A Southern gentleman.

159
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:42,489
Though you all call yourselves
Mid-Atlantic state now.

160
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,124
No, that's just the Northern Virginians.

161
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,360
Well, I want you to know I am

162
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:49,363
fully behind this investigation,
and I have assurances

163
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:51,345
from the department you'll
have their full cooperation.

164
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,566
Well, we appreciate that, ma'am.

165
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:54,541
I'm not a fan of surprises,

166
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,746
so I'd appreciate
being kept up to speed.

167
00:08:56,771 --> 00:08:59,639
That said, she's a busy woman,
so just reach out to me.

168
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:01,107
I'll be at your hotel

169
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:02,742
for the next few days to make
sure you guys get a good start.

170
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:04,344
I want to make sure
to stay in front of this.

171
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:08,081
We don't need any crazy rednecks
looting the local Cracker Barrel.

172
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,416
Yes, ma'am.

173
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:35,775
Move it.

174
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:49,155
I said be quiet.

175
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:55,228
Can I help you?

176
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:57,564
Preston Terry, attorney
with DOJ Civil Rights.

177
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,399
I should have known from the suit.

178
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,935
We're strictly buy one,
get two free down here.

179
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:05,238
- This is Ashe Akino, my investigator.
- Hi.

180
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:06,740
How long you been on the job?

181
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:09,843
Two years patrol, got tapped by DEA,

182
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:12,345
worked Colombia and Mexico
for six years.

183
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,481
And you gave all that up
for the cushy life?

184
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:17,083
I like being my own boss.

185
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:18,818
So where y'all want to start?
Whatever you need.

186
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:20,453
A conversation with Deputy Beck,

187
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:22,088
and then the crime scene.

188
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:24,524
Not a crime scene until
the crime has been determined.

189
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:28,361
- Absolutely right.
- Right.

190
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:30,697
Beck's in Interview Two.

191
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:36,403
All right, guys, roll call.

192
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,943
I'm not talking without my union rep.

193
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,730
Look, I've read your report.

194
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:43,877
I just want to hear it from you.

195
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,313
It's just a conversation.

196
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:49,950
I've been where you're at.

197
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:03,330
My second day on the streets,
I'm out with my T.O.

198
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:05,031
White dude.

199
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:06,900
Routine traffic stop.

200
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,970
Only the kid in the passenger
seat takes off running.

201
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:12,506
So I give chase.

202
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,843
Catch him pretty quick,
but he starts fighting me.

203
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:18,578
My T.O. just stands there watching,

204
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:21,915
wants to see if a girl
can handle herself.

205
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:25,585
I get the upper hand,
when suddenly the kid

206
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,321
is reaching for something behind him.

207
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:29,856
My T.O. is frozen.

208
00:11:29,891 --> 00:11:31,992
He yells, "Gun!"

209
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:35,662
I draw and I shoot
this kid in the chest.

210
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:39,699
Only there's no gun, just a cell phone.

211
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:42,269
18 years old.

212
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:44,871
But I told the truth.

213
00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:46,907
At least I have that.

214
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:48,508
And you were cleared?

215
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:53,095
Ruled justifiable.
I reasonably feared for my life.

216
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:01,054
It was a clean shoot.

217
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:04,111
Tell me about it.

218
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:07,551
I'm on patrol.

219
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:09,529
White guy in a nice vehicle.

220
00:12:09,736 --> 00:12:11,273
White guy in that neighborhood

221
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,867
usually means drugs, so I hit my lights,

222
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,802
pull him over.

223
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:19,339
I approach the vehicle,
ask him a few questions, but...

224
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:21,975
the guy was belligerent.

225
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,810
Refuses to answer anything.

226
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:26,146
So I ask him to step out of the vehicle.

227
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,382
He refuses.

228
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:33,420
So I put my hand on my weapon
and I ask him again.

229
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:37,824
He finally complies,
but as he steps out,

230
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:41,595
he reaches for my gun,
actually gets a hand on it.

231
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:47,331
In that moment, it was either him or me.

232
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:50,003
And I shot him.

233
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,847
Four times.

234
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:55,742
Yes, he continued to struggle.

235
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,411
Was there anything substantiating
your initial suspicions?

236
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:01,314
Lieutenant Breeland found
marijuana, two 20s,

237
00:13:01,349 --> 00:13:02,849
in his search of the vehicle.

238
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:05,051
And was this search done
before or after the shooting?

239
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:07,087
After.

240
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:14,127
Now, you said white guy in
that neighborhood means drugs.

241
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,196
- Yes, sir.
- Was there a legitimate cause

242
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,665
for the initial stop, or was
it all just based on profiling?

243
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:26,072
I'm gonna wait for my union rep now.

244
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,148
He's ready to give me his life
story, and you shut him down.

245
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,016
I don't do anything without a reason.

246
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,585
Really?

247
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:41,187
'Cause it felt like a rookie mistake.

248
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:42,489
From now on,

249
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:44,706
I'll handle the interviews.

250
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,894
Look, I understand you
like being your own boss,

251
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,330
but that's not the case here.

252
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:52,807
Like you said, you follow my lead.

253
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:58,071
Wow, only took you two hours
to start swinging your junk.

254
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:59,939
Most guys at least wait a day.

255
00:13:59,974 --> 00:14:02,609
I don't believe in wasting time.

256
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:04,377
Neither do I.

257
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:06,279
You're a smart brother...
you've seen my file.

258
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,481
So ask yourself, if I tell

259
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,279
Ruiz you don't know
what the hell you're doing,

260
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:12,865
who goes, who stays?

261
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,994
No surveillance cameras,

262
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:00,729
but someone saw something.

263
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:02,464
What's good, sis?

264
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:03,799
I'm Ashe,

265
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,901
from the Department of Justice.

266
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:07,136
We're here investigating a shooting.

267
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,570
- You see anything?
- Nope.

268
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:10,572
- Know anybody who did?
- Yeah.

269
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:11,773
The cop that shot him.

270
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:14,143
- You looking for video?
- You got any?

271
00:15:14,177 --> 00:15:17,079
Yeah, I got the new <i>Star Wars...</i>
not even out yet.

272
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:20,983
Look, we're not police...
we're investigating police.

273
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:22,451
You smell like police.

274
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:23,785
That your squad?

275
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,420
That against the law?

276
00:15:25,455 --> 00:15:27,089
That's my big brother.

277
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:28,290
Whatever, man.

278
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:30,826
I'm serious... real talk, man, look.

279
00:15:33,196 --> 00:15:35,330
Mace a beast!

280
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:36,698
- He's your fam for real?
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,634
How come you're not in the league?

282
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:40,369
Decided to change the world instead.

283
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:42,671
Damn, you messed up.

284
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:45,474
So what's this dude Beck like?

285
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:46,875
He's all right.

286
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,311
Not like the boys who roll through
here cracking heads for nothing.

287
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:50,468
He's a sellout.

288
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:52,814
You don't think the neighborhood
could use black cops?

289
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:54,149
Yeah, but he ain't hood no more.

290
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,784
So y'all ain't seen nothing, or...

291
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:57,619
hear nothing?

292
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,623
No one's got answers for you,

293
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:01,156
'cause you keep asking
the wrong question.

294
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:02,958
So what's the right question?

295
00:16:06,963 --> 00:16:08,030
Aw, man.

296
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:11,266
Look, talk to us... we can protect you.

297
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:19,808
They trying to intimidate them or us?

298
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:26,448
The police have been here two times now,

299
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:28,817
asking these same questions.

300
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:31,253
Meanwhile, this man is still
walking around free.

301
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:33,322
I understand how you feel.

302
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:34,756
No, you don't.

303
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,525
My son is dead.

304
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:42,282
People seem put off by my anger.

305
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,000
They're expecting something else.

306
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:47,306
Do you know why your son
was in that neighborhood?

307
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:49,004
Driving in that neighborhood
is not a crime.

308
00:16:49,038 --> 00:16:50,005
What about drugs?

309
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:52,107
My son didn't do drugs.

310
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:54,376
Did they tell you they found
marijuana in his car?

311
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,478
I don't care.

312
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:57,946
The officer said he went for his gun.

313
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:59,381
Jesse would never do that!

314
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:00,249
How do you know?

315
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:02,117
Because I know my son.

316
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:04,653
Y'all can try to paint him
as a criminal all you want,

317
00:17:04,687 --> 00:17:06,588
but that is not who he was.

318
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:08,790
He was a great kid.

319
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:13,829
And he would hate this shirt.

320
00:17:13,863 --> 00:17:17,332
But the funeral home said
he had to be in a suit,

321
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:21,236
and all he has are T-shirts
with comics on them.

322
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:25,107
So I spent the entire morning
shopping for this dress shirt

323
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:28,110
I know he'd never wear.

324
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:31,940
We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

325
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:36,136
I didn't lose him.

326
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:38,587
He was murdered.

327
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,522
<i>I'm a good cop.</i>

328
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:44,826
Yes, but perception is reality.

329
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,607
You got to change perception.

330
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:52,904
Come to my church.
Make a statement in God's house.

331
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:54,002
I'll stand with you.

332
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:55,103
I'm not making any statements.

333
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:56,605
- Josh, maybe it would be...
- No.

334
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:58,707
Brother, the media's a powerful thing.

335
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:01,209
They can make the guilty
innocent, innocent guilty.

336
00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:03,111
And an unknown pastor a star.

337
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,251
All right, then.

338
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:14,122
Thank you for your hospitality.

339
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:23,432
<i>A tragedy has come</i>

340
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:26,168
to Gate Station, the town I grew up in.

341
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:28,603
A young college student

342
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:30,572
has been killed.

343
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:32,741
And when there are questions,
I want answers.

344
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:36,311
I have personally reached out
to the Department of Justice

345
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:37,946
and asked for an outside prosecutor

346
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,681
to ensure an impartial investigation

347
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:40,782
into this matter.

348
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:42,784
And Sheriff Platt agrees.

349
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:45,253
He, too, wants to make sure
that trust remains

350
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:47,656
between law enforcement
and the community.

351
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,057
What trust?

352
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,361
Yes, ma'am.

353
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:53,795
I would like to introduce Preston Terry,

354
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,097
who will answer any questions.

355
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:57,599
- Mr. Terry, thank you.
- Thank you, Governor.

356
00:18:57,633 --> 00:19:00,802
Is there any video of the shooting,
or any witnesses?

357
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:04,406
Uh, no video has surfaced as of yet,
and no witnesses have come forward.

358
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,640
But it's still early
in the investigation.

359
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:08,477
Can you confirm that the name
of the officer is Joshua Beck?

360
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:10,045
We're not releasing
his name at this time.

361
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,213
But he is black?

362
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:14,119
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- We've all seen the cell phone footage.

363
00:19:14,144 --> 00:19:15,951
The officer is black,
the victim is white.

364
00:19:15,985 --> 00:19:18,720
What I don't understand
is why you're here.

365
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:20,655
All the murdering of unarmed black men

366
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,058
by police across this country, and this

367
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:25,394
is the one that the government
is investigating?

368
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:27,262
Oh, so only black lives matter?

369
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:29,097
I'm sorry, when is the last time
you were pulled over

370
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:31,133
by the police and didn't know if you
were going to make it out alive?

371
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,284
Listen, as a prosecutor,

372
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:35,823
it is my job to ignore
all personal biases

373
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:37,406
and to focus on the truth.

374
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:39,775
And I must admit, that can be hard.

375
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,591
That can be tough.

376
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:45,341
See, when I watch recent video of...
of Laquan McDonald,

377
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:48,350
of Tamir Rice, of Walter Scott,
shot in the back,

378
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,108
murdered while running away
from a child support payment,

379
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,444
I am sickened.

380
00:19:52,537 --> 00:19:54,790
Sickened by the utter lack of humanity

381
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:57,192
displayed by those officers and angered

382
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,294
at the arrogance of their lies.

383
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:00,929
See, now, they knew that
there would be an assumption

384
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:04,499
of innocence not because of
blue, but because of white.

385
00:20:04,534 --> 00:20:07,302
And now an anomaly has occurred.

386
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:10,472
A black police officer has shot
and killed an unarmed white man,

387
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:12,507
and they have sent in the cavalry.

388
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:13,975
Now, is the cavalry here

389
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,877
to bring justice to the unarmed
white man,

390
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:17,879
or to exonerate an innocent
black police officer?

391
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:19,514
I won't know until I've garnered all

392
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,818
: <i>...the facts of the case.
But I am here because every citizen</i>

393
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:25,654
<i>deserves a system
that is fair and transparent.</i>

394
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:28,023
<i>I am here because
we are creating a generation</i>

395
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:29,858
<i>of Americans who are becoming quickly</i>

396
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:33,232
<i>disillusioned with the postracial
America we like to tout.</i>

397
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:35,405
<i>In fact, I'm not even a day
into this case, and already</i>

398
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,065
<i>we see it's about race.</i>

399
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:39,301
But I am not disillusioned.

400
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:41,636
I am working this case as a prosecutor

401
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:42,904
trying to determine

402
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:45,240
what happened that day between two men.

403
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:47,275
And I believe that my success

404
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,311
will serve as an example
to us all of why we have

405
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:53,014
got to start putting
each other's humanity first.

406
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:55,317
None of us will like the America
we end up with

407
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:57,719
if we don't start working
very hard at this.

408
00:20:57,753 --> 00:21:00,589
And that work begins today.

409
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:01,790
Thank you.

410
00:21:01,824 --> 00:21:03,959
Thank you very much.

411
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:06,461
Reporters shouting: Governor!

412
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:08,463
You just made the rest of my day hell.

413
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:09,631
How's that?

414
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:11,166
She worked all morning on that speech,

415
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,135
and now no one will remember
a single word of it.

416
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,171
You owe me for that.

417
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:21,943
Pastor Janae James.

418
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:24,012
Those were some powerful words.

419
00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:26,147
I really hope you're here
to listen, too.

420
00:21:26,182 --> 00:21:27,616
Absolutely.

421
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,018
That's a whole lot harder to do.

422
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:31,720
Why do I feel a sermon coming on?

423
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:35,591
I'll save that for Sunday.

424
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,593
Chosen House, 10:00 a.m.

425
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,493
<i>Today, during a speech on the steps
of Gate Station City Hall...</i>

426
00:21:52,518 --> 00:21:54,654
I'll have what he's having.

427
00:21:54,744 --> 00:21:56,204
It's just orange juice.

428
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:59,147
So y-you just assume I'm a drinker?

429
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:00,916
Educated guess.

430
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,450
I'm sort of offended.

431
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:05,771
You can throw some vodka in there.

432
00:22:08,624 --> 00:22:10,325
Your speech surprised me today.

433
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,527
You don't know me well
enough to be surprised.

434
00:22:12,562 --> 00:22:16,131
You're right... you and I,
we need to find our rhythm.

435
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:17,966
Right now we're just butting heads.

436
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,768
Yeah, well, you're the one banging.

437
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:21,703
You judge too quickly.

438
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:23,204
I was police... it's what we do.

439
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:25,040
You judged me too quickly.

440
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,675
I'm not a sellout.

441
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:28,009
Did I call you one?

442
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:29,477
You called me "their boy."

443
00:22:29,512 --> 00:22:32,781
Fine, fine, I apologize.

444
00:22:32,815 --> 00:22:34,883
I also thought you were gay.

445
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:36,952
Sorry for that, too, I guess.

446
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:38,453
Now, why would you think that?

447
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,741
Because I got nothing
from you when we first met.

448
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:42,557
Yeah, well, maybe you're not my type.

449
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:44,123
I'm every guy's type.

450
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:49,297
Now, anyway, I don't piss where I eat.

451
00:22:49,332 --> 00:22:51,399
Hmm.

452
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:52,801
So what's your type?

453
00:22:52,835 --> 00:22:54,636
I guess I'm waiting on my Michelle.

454
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,670
- Obama?
- Mm-hmm.

455
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:57,706
She's dope... why her?

456
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,107
She's the kind of woman

457
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:02,477
that makes you seem like a better man.

458
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:04,679
Couldn't handle me anyway.

459
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:10,012
That story you told Beck, was that true?

460
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,987
Yep.

461
00:23:13,623 --> 00:23:15,523
How does anyone get over that?

462
00:23:17,026 --> 00:23:20,195
I know it's gonna
come back on me one day.

463
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:23,498
I just, um, don't want it
coming back on my daughter.

464
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:25,634
- How old is she?
- Six.

465
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:31,106
Look, I'll take care of this.

466
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,374
You grab coffee tomorrow.

467
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:33,475
You got it.

468
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:35,710
Boss.

469
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:38,747
You believe half of what
you said in that speech?

470
00:23:40,516 --> 00:23:42,183
Half.

471
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:01,636
Hey.

472
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:02,504
You lost?

473
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:05,173
I'm looking for you.

474
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:07,509
I don't talk to Five-O.

475
00:24:07,543 --> 00:24:09,010
I already told you, I'm not a cop.

476
00:24:09,045 --> 00:24:11,746
Look, bro, I've got nothing to say.

477
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:14,082
I'm going to see
my brother this weekend.

478
00:24:14,116 --> 00:24:15,417
You want a signed football?

479
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:17,752
For real?

480
00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:19,187
You straight bribing me, man.

481
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:20,955
You said I wasn't
asking the right question.

482
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,424
So what do I got to ask?

483
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:25,827
You need to go ask Miss Campbell.

484
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:27,295
Who's Miss Campbell?

485
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:29,297
This lady in The Houses.

486
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:30,899
What are The Houses?

487
00:24:51,053 --> 00:24:52,687
308.

488
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:24,098
Morning.

489
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:25,512
Morning.

490
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,051
- Thanks.
- What the hell?

491
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:29,539
What happened?

492
00:25:29,566 --> 00:25:31,712
Last night, part of town
called The Houses.

493
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:32,968
I was following a lead.

494
00:25:32,993 --> 00:25:34,712
Do you think I'm incapable
of doing my job?

495
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:35,687
No.

496
00:25:35,712 --> 00:25:37,847
Then stop trying to do it for me.

497
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:41,027
I can't keep chalking this
up to you being brand-new.

498
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:42,752
Look, I felt like I made a connection

499
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:44,577
with that kid in the jersey.

500
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:46,386
Okay, I thought maybe
if we spoke one on one

501
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,679
I could get some more info.

502
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:51,087
But you're right... I should have
spoken to you first.

503
00:25:51,112 --> 00:25:52,379
Yeah, you should have.

504
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:54,220
You should see a doctor.

505
00:25:55,284 --> 00:25:57,740
Pride hurts more than
my body, but thank you.

506
00:25:57,967 --> 00:25:59,801
So what'd he tell you?

507
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,223
He told me to speak
to a woman in The Houses

508
00:26:02,248 --> 00:26:04,306
named Miss Campbell in 308.

509
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,557
Which somebody didn't want you to do.

510
00:26:06,582 --> 00:26:08,650
That is the conclusion I'm drawing, yes.

511
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:10,520
So let me go find out what she knows.

512
00:26:10,546 --> 00:26:11,813
You can't go by yourself.

513
00:26:11,847 --> 00:26:13,515
I got a gun.

514
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:40,375
How y'all doing?

515
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,662
Who is it?

516
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:48,416
We're from the Department of Justice.

517
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:49,951
We're here to see Miss Campbell.

518
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,818
Department of Justice...

519
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,121
that's with the government, right?

520
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:56,324
Yes, ma'am, we're here
investigating a shooting.

521
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:11,573
- You're the one was on TV.
- Yes, ma'am.

522
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:13,575
Sounded almost like a preacher.

523
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:14,929
What do you know

524
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:17,589
about the young white kid who
was just killed by the cop?

525
00:27:17,765 --> 00:27:19,914
The white kid... why would I know
anything about that?

526
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:21,750
We were told to ask you the question.

527
00:27:21,784 --> 00:27:24,475
By who? I don't know why they said that.

528
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,987
Do you know Officer Beck?

529
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:29,321
I mean, I seened him around,
but I don't know him.

530
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:31,426
What about the young man
who was killed, Jesse Carr?

531
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,628
I'm sorry, I don't know anything.

532
00:27:45,775 --> 00:27:47,041
When did you lose your son?

533
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:55,417
Thought that's why you was here.

534
00:27:55,451 --> 00:27:56,718
Should've known better.

535
00:27:56,752 --> 00:27:57,685
What do you mean?

536
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,388
I can't talk about it.

537
00:28:00,423 --> 00:28:01,856
Who told you that, your lawyer?

538
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:05,126
The police?

539
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:07,295
Look, we're not police.

540
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:09,030
Whatever you say stays right here.

541
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,332
Your son's death was never investigated?

542
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:15,036
Meanwhile this white boy all over my TV.

543
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,105
What did the police tell you?

544
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:22,977
They knock on my door,
say they found Joey dead.

545
00:28:23,012 --> 00:28:26,147
No "Sorry for your loss, ma'am."

546
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:28,817
No "You okay, ma'am?"

547
00:28:28,851 --> 00:28:31,052
They just come in
and go through his things,

548
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:33,087
and found a bag of weed.

549
00:28:33,122 --> 00:28:36,858
Then another cop come in, say I
could go to jail for that, too.

550
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:39,928
Say I need to stay quiet while
they do their investigation,

551
00:28:39,962 --> 00:28:41,863
otherwise it'd be obstruction,
and the judge

552
00:28:41,897 --> 00:28:43,598
could take away my kid.

553
00:28:43,997 --> 00:28:45,867
Have you heard any more about it?

554
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:48,369
Nothing from police.

555
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:51,306
But people round here are saying
they had something to do with it.

556
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:54,275
There were witnesses?

557
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,479
Just not the right kind.

558
00:28:58,346 --> 00:29:00,548
Guess we figured out the right question.

559
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,383
Nothing she says has anything
to do with our case.

560
00:29:02,418 --> 00:29:03,718
It has everything to do with it.

561
00:29:03,752 --> 00:29:05,820
The department is obviously corrupt.

562
00:29:05,855 --> 00:29:07,489
Just because someone told her the police

563
00:29:07,523 --> 00:29:09,190
were involved doesn't make it fact.

564
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:13,461
But a cop telling her to keep her
mouth shut, or they'll take her kid?

565
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:14,729
We have to dig.

566
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:16,197
Look, I understand your instinct,

567
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:17,799
but that's not why we're here.

568
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:19,501
I don't think you do.

569
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:20,535
What?

570
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:21,836
Share my instincts.

571
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:23,338
'Cause I'm real uncomfortable right now.

572
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:25,485
Look, Beck is the only
brother in the department

573
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,309
in a city that's 65% black.
I'm uncomfortable.

574
00:29:28,344 --> 00:29:30,078
But we have to work the case
we've been assigned.

575
00:29:30,112 --> 00:29:32,714
We do a great job, then we have
the leverage to open it up.

576
00:29:32,748 --> 00:29:34,315
You can do that?

577
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,917
Just forget what you just heard?

578
00:29:35,951 --> 00:29:38,753
I'm not asking you to forget...
I'm asking you to be patient.

579
00:29:38,787 --> 00:29:40,054
Can you do that?

580
00:29:41,457 --> 00:29:42,524
Sure.

581
00:29:47,897 --> 00:29:49,764
Jumps off the balcony.

582
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:52,200
I swear to God this guy
starts pissing himself.

583
00:29:54,803 --> 00:29:56,704
Y'all headed to choir practice?

584
00:29:56,739 --> 00:30:00,108
What do you know about choir practice?

585
00:30:00,142 --> 00:30:02,010
I know I'm buying.

586
00:30:02,044 --> 00:30:03,545
Another one?

587
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:06,881
Where are all the females?

588
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:08,283
Are you looking for one?

589
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:09,417
Come on, now.

590
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:11,419
Cheers.

591
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:15,223
Ooh.

592
00:30:15,257 --> 00:30:17,692
What the hell was that?

593
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:19,093
Prairie Fire.

594
00:30:19,128 --> 00:30:20,528
It's Wild Turkey and Tabasco.

595
00:30:20,563 --> 00:30:23,031
I think I just grew a testicle.

596
00:30:23,065 --> 00:30:25,600
- Y'all get home safe, now.
- Breeland, right?

597
00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:27,802
Lieutenant Breeland.

598
00:30:27,836 --> 00:30:29,871
We were supposed to have a conversation.

599
00:30:29,905 --> 00:30:31,306
Yeah, I don't go in the box.

600
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,074
Wasn't trying to put you there.

601
00:30:33,108 --> 00:30:35,808
You were first on the scene...
just looking for a quick statement.

602
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:45,927
The training officer who
yelled "gun" at your shooting,

603
00:30:46,021 --> 00:30:47,322
was he ever prosecuted?

604
00:30:47,356 --> 00:30:49,214
News travels fast around here.

605
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:50,700
Ah, we're like family.

606
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:52,803
No, he wasn't, either.

607
00:30:52,861 --> 00:30:54,768
I'm not trying to bulldog you here.

608
00:30:54,793 --> 00:30:58,333
I'm just trying to get my head
around why a former cop

609
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:01,102
who killed an unarmed teenager
and didn't get prosecuted is now

610
00:31:01,136 --> 00:31:03,905
- working cops.
- I'm not IA.

611
00:31:03,939 --> 00:31:05,573
I just go after bad guys.

612
00:31:05,608 --> 00:31:07,075
Well, Beck's a good guy.

613
00:31:09,545 --> 00:31:10,945
To good cops.

614
00:31:15,384 --> 00:31:17,285
So what's the deal with The Houses?

615
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,252
What about them?

616
00:31:18,287 --> 00:31:19,420
I keep hearing

617
00:31:19,455 --> 00:31:21,856
it's like the Wild West down there.

618
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,425
Personally, I never ran any tours there.

619
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,260
- Tours?
- It's nothing, it's stupid.

620
00:31:26,295 --> 00:31:29,397
It's like a tour of duty... it's rough.

621
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:30,865
Ashe Akino?

622
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:32,634
Yes?

623
00:31:32,668 --> 00:31:33,968
You've been served.

624
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:47,582
I don't understand.

625
00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:49,584
I don't understand.

626
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,338
<i>I keep making excuses for you, Ashe.</i>

627
00:31:52,363 --> 00:31:53,784
<i>But I can't anymore.</i>

628
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:58,326
<i>I don't think that you're okay.
I don't, I don't trust you.</i>

629
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,061
I would never hurt Kai.

630
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:02,664
I would never hurt her.

631
00:32:03,045 --> 00:32:04,217
<i>Look...</i>

632
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:07,850
Okay, I-I'll get help,
I'll get help, I promise.

633
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,598
<i>You've been saying that for a year.</i>

634
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:10,794
- Javier...
- <i>We can't talk.</i>

635
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:13,366
<i>We can't, we can't talk
about this anymore.</i>

636
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,841
<i>You've got to talk to my lawyer.</i>

637
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:20,415
Javier, she's the only thing
that makes sense.

638
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:21,416
Please.

639
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:23,718
<i>Yeah.</i>

640
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:25,351
She's the only thing that makes sense.

641
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,021
<i>She matters to me, too.</i>

642
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,046
I'll bring you on the field,
bring you backstage,

643
00:32:41,071 --> 00:32:42,738
- the locker room, meet everybody.
- Oh, really?

644
00:32:42,772 --> 00:32:44,280
Yeah, no problem.

645
00:32:45,742 --> 00:32:47,643
So who tuned you up, baby bro?

646
00:32:47,677 --> 00:32:48,944
It's nothing, it's a little scrap.

647
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:50,779
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

648
00:32:50,814 --> 00:32:52,473
Because you know I got people, right?

649
00:32:52,516 --> 00:32:54,850
You talking retaliation
in front of law enforcement?

650
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:56,452
Girl, please, you too pretty
to be a cop.

651
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:57,785
You too pretty to play ball.

652
00:32:59,988 --> 00:33:02,291
So, what, you dig cuffing brothers?

653
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:05,440
I dig cuffing bad guys...
they come in all shades.

654
00:33:05,465 --> 00:33:06,699
Why?

655
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:09,165
- Because I'm good at it.
- What makes you so good?

656
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:12,568
I understand how easy it can happen,

657
00:33:12,705 --> 00:33:15,305
going down that other path.

658
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:17,807
And I respect it.

659
00:33:19,387 --> 00:33:22,586
But I'm sure you prep school Negroes
have a different mindset.

660
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:24,902
No, no, no, no.
Pres, he went to prep schools...

661
00:33:24,998 --> 00:33:27,283
- I'm a hood cat.
- You wear that like it's a badge.

662
00:33:27,324 --> 00:33:28,658
Hell yeah, fought for everything I got,

663
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:30,352
ain't nothing was handed to me.

664
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:32,755
- Trust me, you had it easier.
- Please.

665
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:34,900
Do you know where this boy spent
his summers in high school?

666
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:36,058
The Alps.

667
00:33:36,092 --> 00:33:37,843
His best friend's pop was a billionaire.

668
00:33:37,868 --> 00:33:40,547
But it's all good, because our parents
are living in a house...

669
00:33:40,743 --> 00:33:42,493
that I paid for.

670
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,768
What's your shelf life, Mace?

671
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:47,698
Five years?

672
00:33:47,723 --> 00:33:49,972
Look, I'll be running Justice by
then, and just getting started.

673
00:33:50,006 --> 00:33:51,473
Yeah, I saw you on TV.

674
00:33:51,508 --> 00:33:53,309
How is it you always end up
playing for the wrong team?

675
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:55,210
It's funny how black folks
on the sidelines are always

676
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:56,492
the ones questioning loyalty.

677
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:57,804
I never played on no sidelines.

678
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:58,881
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

679
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:00,583
So, what, you think tweeting
"Black lives matter"

680
00:34:00,617 --> 00:34:03,018
to your million followers
makes you Jackie Robinson?

681
00:34:03,053 --> 00:34:06,188
1.4... and at least folks know
what side I'm on.

682
00:34:06,222 --> 00:34:08,557
Damn, I thought...

683
00:34:08,592 --> 00:34:11,260
I thought I missed out, being
an only child, but I guess not.

684
00:34:11,294 --> 00:34:12,962
Nah, we go.

685
00:34:14,598 --> 00:34:16,999
But it's all love.

686
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:18,334
Right, baby bro?

687
00:34:18,368 --> 00:34:19,568
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

688
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:20,569
All love.

689
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:22,071
Look.

690
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:23,706
Appreciate the meal.

691
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:26,609
We've got work to do.

692
00:34:27,336 --> 00:34:30,328
I'm not walking away
from this $50 steak.

693
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:31,976
It's all good... I'll take her home.

694
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:36,500
See you tomorrow.

695
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:56,705
I was surprised to get your text.

696
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,540
You said I owe you.

697
00:34:58,575 --> 00:35:00,909
Actually, um, I owe you.

698
00:35:00,944 --> 00:35:02,344
How's that?

699
00:35:02,379 --> 00:35:06,148
Your speech was the lead story
on every statewide affiliate,

700
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:09,243
and on the front page
of every local newspaper.

701
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:13,102
And the governor is standing
right there next to you.

702
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,779
Come on.

703
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,506
<i>You're making me blush.</i>

704
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,042
Really, under all that chocolate?

705
00:35:35,445 --> 00:35:38,947
You know he thinks we're
hitting it right now, right?

706
00:35:38,982 --> 00:35:40,249
So why aren't we?

707
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:43,976
Because if we do, I won't respect you.

708
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:46,789
And I think I like you.

709
00:35:46,823 --> 00:35:49,191
Maybe I don't want
to be liked right now.

710
00:35:51,895 --> 00:35:53,629
Wow.

711
00:35:53,663 --> 00:35:55,464
Girl, you sexy as hell.

712
00:35:55,498 --> 00:35:57,332
But you've got some of the saddest eyes

713
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:59,702
I've ever seen.

714
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:03,866
I don't know, maybe
that's why I'm digging you.

715
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:06,875
I appreciate the sentiment,

716
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:11,013
but, um, you sound like
a real bitch right now.

717
00:36:15,018 --> 00:36:17,071
- Oh.
- Mm-hm.

718
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:47,431
No, Shirlane, this is
not how things work.

719
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,585
I don't give a damn about a heads up.

720
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:50,986
That's too late.

721
00:36:51,011 --> 00:36:53,021
You're going to get me fired.

722
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:55,457
When's it running?

723
00:36:56,693 --> 00:36:59,134
- What's going on?
- A video just hit.

724
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,665
Of what?

725
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,667
<i>But what is quite clear
are the racist remarks.</i>

726
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:05,801
<i>Officials say those remarks
are from Joshua Beck,</i>

727
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:08,237
<i>an African-American deputy.</i>

728
00:37:08,271 --> 00:37:09,805
<i>All right, fam.</i>

729
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,740
<i>Just graduated from the Academy.</i>

730
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:14,209
<i>Grown-ass man now. Any last words?</i>

731
00:37:14,244 --> 00:37:16,245
Uh, yeah.

732
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:19,595
Um... finally got my license
to shoot these crackers.

733
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,817
That's right, Josh.

734
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:23,667
That's right, my boy's bulletproof.

735
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:25,587
<i>Now, we've
heard no comment from Deputy Beck</i>

736
00:37:25,629 --> 00:37:27,081
<i>or the Gate Station Sheriff's Office</i>

737
00:37:27,106 --> 00:37:28,855
<i>regarding this inflammatory video.</i>

738
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,747
Hello?

739
00:37:29,772 --> 00:37:32,278
<i>- Sources within the department say...
- Mm-hmm, yeah.</i>

740
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,993
I was drunk, sir.

741
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,841
Just, uh, popping off at the mouth.

742
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:47,240
You know that's not how I really feel.

743
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,576
Hell, I've said things
sober that'd get me fired.

744
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,749
No one here's taking offense.

745
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,258
Thank you, Kerry.

746
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,211
What about the guys?

747
00:37:58,236 --> 00:38:01,578
Well, there's a box of saltines
on your desk with a bow on it.

748
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:07,760
Unfortunately, the media's
not so forgiving.

749
00:38:07,887 --> 00:38:09,188
I can handle that.

750
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:10,330
I know you can.

751
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:13,090
But I think it's best we
keep you on administrative duty

752
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,336
until these DOJ people
finish their investigation.

753
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:16,619
- What?
- Daddy!

754
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,395
Okay, little man.

755
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,755
- Okay.
- Hello!

756
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,898
Not right now, son.

757
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:23,734
I'm sorry. Hey, I think you're
missing a shirt, little man.

758
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:26,347
Sorry.

759
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:27,438
Christian!

760
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,021
There he goes.

761
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,744
Look, it's not fair,

762
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,813
but you're a distraction.

763
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,481
It's gonna be impossible to do your job.

764
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:40,184
Then I'll make a statement,
let the people hear from me.

765
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:42,598
Josh, what did the union rep say to you?

766
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:45,097
Under no circumstances
do you talk to the media.

767
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:49,223
And this prosecutor,
you don't talk to him alone.

768
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:53,497
And you never deviate from the language.

769
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,367
"In the moment of engagement,
I feared for my life."

770
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,702
- I did, sir.
- Good.

771
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:00,337
The truth's easier to remember.

772
00:39:03,477 --> 00:39:04,720
Morning.

773
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:06,492
- Have you seen the video?
- Not a good look.

774
00:39:06,517 --> 00:39:07,878
I've been in touch
with the governor's office.

775
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,313
They want to know who leaked it.

776
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,881
Me, too.

777
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,116
I'll be ready in 20 minutes.

778
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,785
Can I ask you a lawyer question?

779
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:15,886
About another case?

780
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,987
Yeah.

781
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,989
- What's the grounds for sole custody?
- For which parent?

782
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,158
- Does it matter?
- In some cases, yeah.

783
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,293
The father.

784
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:25,062
Proof the mother is unfit.

785
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,497
Drugs, alcohol abuse.

786
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,098
Threat to the safety of the child.

787
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,801
Pattern of unaccountability.

788
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,136
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

789
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,305
You know it didn't mean
anything to him, right?

790
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,144
Didn't mean anything to me, either.

791
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:46,016
Scripture tells us,
"Blessed are those that mourn,

792
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,485
for they shall be comforted."

793
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:53,757
Black America has been
in a state of mourning

794
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:54,858
for far too long.

795
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,194
Mourning the loss

796
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,745
of so many of our sons
and daughters because the world

797
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,809
has weaponized our blackness.

798
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,368
In its eyes,

799
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,769
we're never unarmed.

800
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:08,966
And now we add another name.

801
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,275
Joey Campbell.

802
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:14,545
17 years old, killed two weeks ago.

803
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,135
We heard about it in the way it's
always been, through whispers.

804
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:20,984
But the world doesn't know.

805
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:25,065
The world doesn't know, because
the police aren't investigating.

806
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,346
But the world is gonna know.

807
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:34,310
Church, I'm bringing up someone
who needs our support.

808
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:38,029
Shameeka Campbell, his mother.

809
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,343
Family.

810
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:50,570
We know what it's like
to lose someone to the police.

811
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:53,999
And we also know that two wrongs
don't make a right.

812
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,054
Every parent wants their child home.

813
00:40:58,408 --> 00:41:03,178
So I'm bringing up another
mother who needs our support.

814
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:14,938
Come on, church.

815
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,273
The greatest of these is what?

816
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,208
Love. How?

817
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:21,245
We love our neighbor as ourself.

818
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,048
This mother loved

819
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:28,018
her child no less than anybody else.

820
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,690
Family, let's be united.

821
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:33,143
Let's get both these murdered children

822
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:35,959
the justice they deserve.

The governor reached out to Carroll.
