1
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:09,291
Your son lost my gold to Bob Fink.

2
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:11,750
Actually, Fink doesn't have it. He's dead.

3
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:13,250
The safe house on Rivington Street.

4
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:14,333
Take her to Elm Lodge.

5
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,833
It's a bit close to home, sir.

6
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,559
I don't intend to let this out of my sight.

7
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,458
And he said 30 hours
to this exchange, right?

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,292
So that gives us enough time
to track him down, right?

9
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,292
We got three phases... phase one is intel.

10
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,792
Phase two is the takedown.

11
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,583
Phase three is the getaway.

12
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:31,957
Where's my dad?

13
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,238
He's in the back of Jones's van.

14
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,458
Coming to get you, Vic!
Hang on in there, mate.

15
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,375
Come on, come on!

16
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,083
You piece of shit thing.

17
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,291
Come on, Dad, pick up.

18
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:05,875
Come on, Dad, don't do this
to me, pick up, pick up.

19
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:10,250
- Shit.
- He's probably got no signal

20
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,625
in the back of that metal box.

21
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,583
Well, I just hope it's not a metal coffin.

22
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,417
Well, I haven't seen you for a while.

23
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,291
- Albert.
- Mum?

24
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:52,291
What's going on?

25
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,559
This is all kicked off, Mum, all right?

26
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,792
- We got rumbled.
- And?

27
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,792
Norman got shot, Mum.

28
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,208
He's gone.

29
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,708
God bless him.

30
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,125
Did you get the info on the exchange?

31
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:18,708
Yeah, we did. It's Liverpool Docks.

32
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,458
The buyer's name is Petru.

33
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,624
He's coming in from some
place called Ajaccio.

34
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,124
He's gotta leave before the morning tide.

35
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,434
We're following Jones in the van now.

36
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,500
We're on our way.

37
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:27,792
- Albert?
- Yeah?

38
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,292
Where's your father?

39
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,125
I'll give it to them.

40
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,500
They've got some balls
coming after us like that.

41
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,957
This Vic Hill, he's harder
to kill than a cockroach.

42
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,583
Ain't no killing me.

43
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,309
He's a relentless bastard,
I'll give him that.

44
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,917
He almost took us down.

45
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,792
Your boys almost fell
asleep on the job, Dwyer.

46
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,208
Well, at least all that spilt
claret will give your wife

47
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,333
an excuse to redecorate Elm Lodge... again.

48
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,375
Leave the irony to the ironic, Dwyer.

49
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:06,625
You're engaged solely for
your more... basic instincts.

50
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:11,500
If the cockroach want
for take over the chicken,

51
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,792
it must hire fox as a henchman.

52
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,792
One minute, girls.

53
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,000
That's badass.

54
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,333
Right. Move it.

55
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,042
Or it's perms all around.

56
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,250
Good boy, Scooter.

57
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:14,750
Go on, have that.

58
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,083
Al, just wondering...

59
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,833
what exactly are we gonna
do when we get to the docks?

60
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,583
Disruption, extraction, escape.

61
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,542
Yeah, what do each of
those phases entail exactly?

62
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,292
Well, that's the bit I'm
still working on, Charlie.

63
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,500
We getting anywhere, girls?

64
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,500
The Liverpool docks are massive.

65
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,957
12 kilometers long

66
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,434
and 4 million square feet of warehouses.

67
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,000
We need to narrow it down.

68
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,726
Where did Albert say it was departing from?

69
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,250
The Ajaccio, port city on
the west coast of Corsica.

70
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:47,791
And the buyer's name is Petru.

71
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:50,625
Petru, a Christian name common in Finland,

72
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,250
- Romania, and Corsica!
- Corsica!

73
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:55,083
Well, now we know where
it's coming in from.

74
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,393
What we need to find out is
what time and where it's docking.

75
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:59,250
Three hours till Liverpool.

76
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,083
Doesn't this tin can go any faster?

77
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,143
I'm thrashing her like a nag on
Derby day, Charlie, all right?

78
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:05,083
You're welcome to get out and push.

79
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,291
Sit. Paw. And spin around for me.

80
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:11,625
Down.

81
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,125
Who's a good boy?

82
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:14,375
Sit.

83
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,750
Jesus, this dog can do anything.

84
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:20,125
I swear, he must be
police-trained or something.

85
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,083
Scooter, away.

86
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,208
Told ya.

87
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,292
He's a good boy, he's a good boy!

88
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,072
Well, that could come in useful.

89
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,375
Shit.

90
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:46,708
Phone just died.

91
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,750
No worries.

92
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,792
Just by magic, I have another one.

93
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,792
Jesus, Charlie. How
many phones have you got?

94
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,542
No, this is our old pal Bob Fink's.

95
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,375
You stealing a dead man's phone for?

96
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,917
That's a step too far, ain't it?

97
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,500
It's linked to his CCTV
cameras in his flat.

98
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,309
I could use it as
evidence when I sue the ass

99
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,143
out of the metropolitan
police for being kidnapped

100
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,791
and beaten by one of their detectives.

101
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:10,375
Okay, wait a minute, that
phone is linked to the CCTV

102
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,792
in Fink's flat.

103
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,125
Was it the same flat that
Jones shot and murdered him in?

104
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,542
Well... now that you mention it, yeah.

105
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,101
Well, turn it on then. Let's have a gander.

106
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,375
Yeah.

107
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:22,417
Shit.

108
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,083
Time to get clever, chaps.

109
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:20,792
We've got three cracks at
this before it locks us out.

110
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,042
Seven letters.

111
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,083
"Bullion."

112
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,167
- Try "bullion."
- Yeah?

113
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,125
It's a good a guess as any.

114
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,291
Bullion.

115
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:34,708
Access denied. Two left.

116
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,042
I found a website with all the boats

117
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,833
coming in and out of Liverpool.

118
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,851
It says where they're from and
when and where they're docking.

119
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,417
Any sign of our Corsican friends?

120
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,833
There's hundreds of boats.

121
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,226
This is gonna take ages to go through.

122
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,958
Say the boys actually do boost the money.

123
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
How we going to escape, Lily?

124
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:53,059
It's not like The Flying
Squad are gonna let us rock off

125
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,708
into the sunset without a fight.

126
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,375
We'll improvise as
opportunities present themselves.

127
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,000
And if option "A" doesn't work,

128
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,625
then there's still 25 other
letters of the alphabet,

129
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:04,792
- right, Lotti?
- Right, Lily.

130
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,809
All right, so we had a proper
obsession with my old man,

131
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,917
- didn't he? Try his name.
- Worth a shot.

132
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,792
Vic Hill.

133
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,957
Obviously not that obsessed.

134
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,625
Access denied. One left.

135
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,083
You know, if this all goes to plan,

136
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,268
I'll be beating the shit out
of you in a paradise beach

137
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:24,917
for the rest of our days.

138
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,958
You're becoming needy, Dwyer.

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,167
It doesn't suit you.

140
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,875
You're a world-class prick... sir.

141
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,542
Thank you.

142
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,417
Jesus Christ!

143
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:56,083
Shit! Vic Hill's pet Neanderthal.

144
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,083
I'm beginning to believe that
their obsession with my gold

145
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,583
is bordering on the demented.

146
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,875
I'll put one between his eyes.

147
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:04,583
No! Let me deal with it.

148
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,791
Nice to see you again.

149
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,000
What did you say your name was?

150
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,624
Them call me Windrush.

151
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,333
Yeah.

152
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,624
And who are you? Hate 'Em All Henry.

153
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:37,625
Don't forget it.

154
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,208
Respect.

155
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,542
You have to earn my respect.

156
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,625
Come on!

157
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,958
Time to cut up your ass, mate.

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,167
Now we're even.

159
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,083
You want this?

160
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,625
This shouldn't take long.

161
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,417
I see your way. Come on...

162
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,833
Come on...

163
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,375
Yah!

164
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:55,250
Is that it?!

165
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,542
Gotcha!

166
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,208
Shit!

167
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,292
I'm gonna kill ya!

168
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,833
My God!

169
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,957
Last chance to crack it.

170
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,292
Get the ball. Go, Scooter.

171
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:12,042
Surely not.

172
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:17,124
Yeah, I got it.

173
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,750
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it worked.

174
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,792
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

175
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,292
Well done.

176
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:26,875
Scooter... put that down

177
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,750
before you blow us all up.

178
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,208
Please, put that down.

179
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,708
Billy, what is going on back there?

180
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,250
Good boy, good boy.

181
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:36,958
Scooter, good boy, good boy.

182
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,792
He only went copped hold of one of these.

183
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,833
Oi!

184
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:47,458
Billy, how many of those
pineapples you got back there?

185
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,375
I'd say about half a dozen.

186
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,791
Yah!

187
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,125
Aah!

188
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,875
Hey, wait...

189
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,875
Wait.

190
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:44,167
One last smoke. Hang on, man.

191
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,333
Respect.

192
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,292
Fuck your respect!

193
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,500
Hate 'Em?

194
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,500
Hate 'Em?

195
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,750
You all right, luv?

196
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,125
I could murder a
bacon sandwich, Mrs. H.

197
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,125
Come on, luv, let's get you up?

198
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,708
Hang in there, big fella.

199
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,250
I've got one.

200
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:24,393
The Panizzi, boat coming in from Corsica.

201
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:27,167
Registered to a Peter Shryer.

202
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,250
Peter, Petru. It's the same name!

203
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:30,917
- Yes!
- Just in different countries!

204
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,434
Does it tell you where
it's scheduled to dock?

205
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,208
Pier Nine, Dock Four in an hour.

206
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,957
Right, hold on to your tits, girls.

207
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,208
I've got into the CCTV footage.

208
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:41,708
- Little agendas.
- Well.

209
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,583
Jeez.

210
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,957
Yeah, all right, I'm not even sure.

211
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,624
Fink deserved to go out like that.

212
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,791
Can you upload that?

213
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:49,792
Yeah, I can try.

214
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:03,417
- Mum, what you got?
- Pier nine, dock four.

215
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,417
The Corsicans dock in an hour, Albert.

216
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:09,125
Okay. Here's the deal.

217
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:10,875
Text my old man again.

218
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,458
Get him to send me a smoke
signal or something, please.

219
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Quickly.

220
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,750
Yes!

221
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:38,958
Dad! Dad's all right.

222
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,667
So you boys know what you gotta do?

223
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,167
And you, you're with us now, isn't ya?

224
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:11,208
All right, well, let's do this, good luck.

225
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,124
Corsicans.

226
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,583
Thank you for stating the obvious, Dwyer.

227
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,458
Chief Superintendent Jones.

228
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:40,583
Petru.

229
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,917
I see you've brought backup.

230
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:48,667
We're all gangsters, no?

231
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,792
Even if we hide behind uniforms.

232
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:54,625
The gold. It is in the van?

233
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,292
It's close by.

234
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,457
But first,

235
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,875
we'll examine the money.

236
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,791
Make sure the ink is dry.

237
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:10,083
Now this is, English humor?

238
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:13,625
I prefer to call it English pragmatism.

239
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,333
Well, here goes nothing, then.

240
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:16,333
Now... ze gold.

241
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,124
Heh!

242
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,417
Ze gold! Ooh la la!

243
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,375
Open the door, Dwyer.

244
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,500
Heads I win...

245
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,875
tails you lose.

246
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:45,000
Here's Victor!

247
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:50,042
Don't move.

248
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:52,291
You lot really do
need a new catchphrase.

249
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:53,791
All right, all right, all right... oof!

250
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,291
Unh!

251
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:57,791
No need for hostility.

252
00:24:57,792 --> 00:24:59,583
I come in peace.

253
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:03,583
You really are a
monumental pain in the ass.

254
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:07,208
What the hell is this,
Jones? Who's this man?

255
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,250
This man...

256
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:14,457
is a floater in the toilet of life.

257
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,000
Soon to be flushed.

258
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:17,417
I bet you a pile of dodgy metal

259
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:19,583
it all ends in Claret.

260
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:22,875
Right, Victor.

261
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:32,791
What now?

262
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,792
What is this, Dwyer?

263
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:49,583
Un chien, un chien.

264
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,957
What the fuck is this?

265
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:54,124
No!

266
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,667
- Boss! You okay, boss?
- Fuck! Fuck!

267
00:25:57,708 --> 00:26:00,792
Aah! Unh!

268
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:05,208
It's a bomb-dog!

269
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,250
It's brilliant.

270
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,500
Now who the hell is this?

271
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:30,957
Heh! He's my son, Albert.

272
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,042
One more move out of any of you,

273
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:39,375
and it's Christmas come early, comprende?

274
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:46,625
Now...

275
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:48,333
I've just come for me dad.

276
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,000
Bollocks to the gold. You can keep that.

277
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,583
It's all a bluff.

278
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,833
They want it all.

279
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:59,292
Either I leave with my old man right now,

280
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,333
or we all go up.

281
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:09,958
No one's going anywhere.

282
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,417
Let him go, you fucking idiot.

283
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:13,957
There's enough grenades on this mutt

284
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,792
to take out all of us.

285
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,875
Go on.

286
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:28,708
Put it down.

287
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:34,917
Get up, Hill!

288
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,458
All right.

289
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,917
Au revoir.

290
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:56,791
- Trust me?
- All the way, son.

291
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:58,458
There'll be no rock

292
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:02,042
big enough for you to hide under.

293
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,000
No, no.

294
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:05,559
I think it's you that's
gonna need the rock,

295
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,250
Chief Superintendent Jones.

296
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,500
Albert?

297
00:28:26,292 --> 00:28:28,292
You'll pay!

298
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,958
Dad, let's move.

299
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:06,708
Police, stay down!

300
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:17,457
The money!

301
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:19,292
Shit!

302
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,167
Shit!

303
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,542
Go!

304
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,208
Aah!

305
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,458
- In the van, Charlie!
- Fuck!

306
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,000
Start her up, Charlie!

307
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,792
God, no! The van won't start!

308
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,750
Out! To the cop car! Come on!

309
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:16,208
Come on, come on, Charlie!

310
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,750
Go, go, go-go-go-go!

311
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,167
Come on, Charlie...
just throw it in there!

312
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,417
Get that gun!

313
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:55,833
- Get in!
- There's no room, Charlie!

314
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:57,250
How do you suggest we do that?

315
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:58,875
Charlie, Dock 14, we'll meet you there!

316
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,458
Go, go!

317
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,375
Police, stop, stop!

318
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,624
Aah! Aah!

319
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:10,333
Around there, boy, around there!

320
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,458
Hit it, Charlie, come on!

321
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,125
Whoa... they're getting away!

322
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,458
Aah! Police!

323
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,167
Shit, they're gaining on us, Charlie!

324
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,167
I said fast!

325
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:05,624
Forward, ho!

326
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,625
- Aah!
- Aah!

327
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,875
Aah!

328
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,563
Where'd you learn to drive like this?

329
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:29,042
Reverse, reverse,
Charlie! Come on! Quicker!

330
00:32:55,417 --> 00:32:57,000
They do not give up!

331
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,958
Easy, Charlie!

332
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,208
- Shit!
- Shit!

333
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,542
No!

334
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,292
Aah!

335
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:26,167
- What do we do now?
- Shit.

336
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,957
Come out of the car with your hands up!

337
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:30,708
You can pray for a bloody miracle.

338
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,833
- What's that?
- Sh...

339
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,458
Boy, we're really flying now, Charlie!

340
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:00,375
This is the life.

341
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,667
Hands above your head.

342
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:33,083
We've been planning this
takedown for months, you idiot.

343
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,042
Chief Superintendent Jones,

344
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,957
I'm arresting you on
suspicion of the murder

345
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,542
of D.I. Robert Fink.

346
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:42,792
D.I. Fink's murdered?

347
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,457
What are you talking about?

348
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:49,167
There's a video been sent
anonymously to us, sir.

349
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,583
CCTV footage of Fink's brains

350
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:54,458
painting the walls, you giving the order.

351
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:56,458
All these grudges,

352
00:34:56,542 --> 00:35:01,333
these... seedy, little agendas.

353
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,333
Well.

354
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,625
You do not have to say anything,

355
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,907
but it might harm your defense
if you do not mention w...

356
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:28,457
You really are an animal, Dwyer.

357
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:31,833
The gold is by the water, sir.

358
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:49,542
Sailor boy.

359
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:04,124
What are you doing with my gold, Petru?

360
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:07,000
It is my gold now.

361
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,625
You son of a...

362
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,000
Don't move, I'll shoot!

363
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:15,083
Drop your gun.

364
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:21,125
- Don't be silly, son.
- Drop your guns!

365
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,208
You bastard, sir.

366
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:48,000
It's been excruciating, Dwyer.

367
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:59,292
Mum? Dock 14, right now.

368
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:01,291
We'll be there in a tic.

369
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,917
Oi, son, you don't happen to have

370
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:11,958
another one of those
grenades handy, do you?

371
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,667
Well, as it happens...

372
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,708
If I can't have you, nobody can.

373
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:51,208
Chop-chop, chop-chop,
boys, come on.

374
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,667
Move it!

375
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,458
Scooter?

376
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:40,042
Come on, come on!

377
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:44,167
Come on!

378
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:51,208
Couldn't run away, could
you, Scooter? Good boy.

379
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:07,750
The fat lady sings.

380
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:21,500
Come on!

381
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:33,167
Chloe Koen,

382
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:34,791
I'm gonna kiss you.

383
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:37,958
Please do, Mr. Canvendish Scott.

384
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:41,125
Yes!

385
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,957
It's about time, son, about time.

386
00:39:47,042 --> 00:39:49,708
Hey, now you can afford to
take me on a proper date.

387
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,125
You'd be lucky.

388
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:52,500
Now you're in trouble, son,

389
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:54,708
now you're in trouble.

390
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,250
Whoo!

391
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:58,833
I told you I'd sort it, Lil.

392
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:01,625
I never doubted
you for a minute, Victor.

393
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:01,124
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

394
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,292
There's still one more
thing we need to sort out.

395
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:10,125
Who knows the way to Spain?

396
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:16,458
We're going to Spain, baby!

397
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,292
Whoo!

398
00:41:57,044 --> 00:42:01,623
