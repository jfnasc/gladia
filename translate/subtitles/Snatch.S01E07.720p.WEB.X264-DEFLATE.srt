1
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:07,582
Have you any idea
just how much shit

2
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:09,332
your boy and his mates are in?

3
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:11,166
Witness says
they were negotiating

4
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:12,624
with a bunch of sheiks over
what looked like a gold bath.

5
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:13,625
Gold bath.

6
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:15,207
Spread the word, Hate 'Em.

7
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:18,042
The Mad Hatter's Tea Party
will commence tomorrow.

8
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:20,957
Vic Hill escaped.

9
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,624
Took a guard hostage
and staged a riot.

10
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,291
- When you'd two get out?
- About 37 minutes ago.

11
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,666
What's gotten into you?

12
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:28,082
He thinks you put
the moves on her.

13
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,332
I am not putting
the moves on Chloe.

14
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,666
Tread carefully.

15
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:32,457
The posh one's got
a hard on for you.

16
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,249
Of course I take you
seriously, Charlie.

17
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,792
No, look, I... I mean...
that way.

18
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,999
You should be in prison

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,416
finishing out
the rest of your sentence.

20
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:09,249
What the hell have you
gone and done?

21
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,249
I think I should be asking you
the very same question.

22
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,374
My old lady
suppin' a glass of wine

23
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,499
with my old mate.

24
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,999
Very fucking cozy.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,499
Only Vic Hill could think
two friends

26
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,041
having a meal together
needs more explaining

27
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:20,707
than a bloody jailbreak.

28
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,332
Well, the imagination
doesn't too many fences to leap

29
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,457
before it runs wild,
if you know what I mean.

30
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,499
Just take a breath, Vic.

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,957
Lily was arrested last night,
and we thought it best

32
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,332
that she didn't
go back home alone.

33
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,999
Arrested? For what?

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,582
It was nothing, you don't
need to worry about it.

35
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,499
No, he needs to know, Lil.

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,707
Bob Fink planted a shooter
at the house.

37
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,457
Pinched her
on a false gun charge.

38
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,541
Bob Fink?

39
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:45,541
Why'd he come through the doors?

40
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:47,041
I don't know, Vic.

41
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,332
Maybe he thought I had
an ear on the gossip.

42
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,582
This bullion robbery's
got everyone

43
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,416
riled up all over again.

44
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:55,083
And do you... have an ear
on the gossip, Lil?

45
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:02,207
15 years later, and you're
still obsessed with the gold.

46
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,000
You haven't even given me a hug.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,999
She's been through the wringer.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,458
She needs your support, mate.

49
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,000
Am I to understand
that you're advising me...

50
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,957
- how to talk to my wife?
- No.

51
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,457
No, not at all, Vic.

52
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,249
I'm just trying to keep
everybody happy.

53
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,332
Then do just that, Norm.

54
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,332
Keep me happy.

55
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,666
Give me a clue.

56
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:42,124
A whiff to sniff out my pile.

57
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:46,166
You're chasing shadows, Vic.

58
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:48,832
- Hate 'Em?
- Vic?

59
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,582
Fancy a stroll?

60
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:54,291
Nothing like an afternoon
walk to give one clarity.

61
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:56,292
What do you say, Norman?

62
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,166
That's a quality job
we did on that.

63
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:20,749
See, this is not a question

64
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,291
about quality, Uncle Dean.

65
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:24,542
Yeah, more a question
of portability.

66
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,124
You what?

67
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,125
Move around-able-ness?

68
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:37,666
See, a bath's a bit
difficult to move, innit?

69
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:41,875
More, we...
gonna need it re-smelted.

70
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:45,833
Re-smelted?

71
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,375
The fu...

72
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,499
We will do it.

73
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,041
On one condition.

74
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:02,832
All right.

75
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,500
Who have I gotta
iron out this time?

76
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,166
No, no! Hey, no!

77
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,499
No, no!

78
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,457
No fighting this time,
Billy son.

79
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,582
Just a wee chat.

80
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,917
A wee chat?

81
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,916
Oi, come here. You all right?

82
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:29,707
I got Norman's message.

83
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,041
Told me Bob Fink
had arrested ya.

84
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:32,541
Yeah, we've got

85
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,499
bigger problems than Fink
right now, Albert.

86
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,832
Go on.

87
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,749
Your dad's out.

88
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,499
He's out?
What do you mean he's out?

89
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,582
As in out of prison.

90
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,332
Bowling around
as free as a bird.

91
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,999
Busted out with Hate 'Em All
this afternoon.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,291
He's broken out to get the gold.

93
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:56,291
All roads leave to Rome.

94
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,082
Selfish prick.

95
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,332
We've gotta tell him
we've got it.

96
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,832
No, no, you can't
do that, Albert.

97
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,624
- Why?
- He's not thinking straight.

98
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,332
He'll mess it all up, and
he'll take you down with him.

99
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,457
What you gotta do

100
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,499
is get him off the street,
just get him off the street.

101
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,207
Yeah?

102
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,457
Who's this?

103
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,124
This is Chloe Koen, Mum,
my business associate.

104
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,499
Hey, Mrs. Hill.
It's really nice to meet you.

105
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,499
Since when did you have
a business associate?

106
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,166
Chloe, fill her in. You be nice.

107
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,832
I'm gonna go have
a look for him.

108
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,208
There are only a couple
places that he could be.

109
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,666
So tell me, Chloe...

110
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:35,041
What exactly is your racket?

111
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:38,666
Well, I... I'm not sure
what my racket is, Mrs. Hill.

112
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:41,124
I've just been helping
Albert with some connections

113
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,832
to help move...

114
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,291
The... consignment.

115
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:49,374
You're too pretty for a fence.

116
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,582
I don't see myself as a fence.

117
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,541
More of a facilitator.

118
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:57,124
And are you
an effective facilitator?

119
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,416
Heh!

120
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,916
I'd say I was
a work in progress.

121
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:05,166
And can you actually help
Albert move this consignment,

122
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,666
or are you just
pissing in the wind

123
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,832
like everybody else
in this neighborhood?

124
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,124
I'm doing my best, Mrs. Hill.

125
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,999
Well, I need you
to do better, Chloe.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,208
My family's in trouble.

127
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,332
What are you doing here,
Master Charles?

128
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:29,499
What are you doing here, Staff?

129
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,541
I attend the manor house
once monthly

130
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,582
to besom out the cobwebs.

131
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,166
"Time will surrender dormant

132
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:41,082
"so the rainbows of new eras
can emerge.

133
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,167
Despite the hollowness of you."

134
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,207
I think a hot bath
and a change of clothes for you.

135
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,666
I can't have a bath,
my dear friend.

136
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:54,666
The gold tub is gone.

137
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,874
Long gone.

138
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,707
Gold tub, Master Charles?

139
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,332
It's presently being re-smelted

140
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:06,832
into a giant, gold,
gleaming bust of Albert Hill

141
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:11,541
by Uncle Dean and his clan
of gypsy artisans.

142
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,207
What on earth
are you talking about?

143
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:18,332
Shh. I speak secrets.

144
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,749
To London, Staff.

145
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,499
All this country air

146
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,167
is starting to repair my lungs.

147
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Whoa!

148
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,541
Christ's sake, Dwyer,
is nowhere sacred?

149
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:42,124
Sorry, sir, it's Bob Fink.

150
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,999
He's become
a full-blown liability.

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,957
Shot up a carpark, killing
Father John in the process.

152
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,666
Then takes it upon himself
to pinch Lily Hill

153
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,166
on a trumped up gun charge.

154
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:54,707
Look... If Fink wants
to piss the day away

155
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,749
chasing B-listers, he can
arrest the family goldfish

156
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,707
for all I care.

157
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,708
He's up to something, sir.
I think that he's got a lead.

158
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,832
You have an entire unit

159
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,417
of the Flying Squad
at your disposal.

160
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,124
Do you need a bigger strap-on

161
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,541
to sort out one problematic
little officer?

162
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:24,292
No, the strap-on I have
should suffice, sir.

163
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:32,207
You need to focus your
attention on finding Vic Hill.

164
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,999
If anyone can lead us
to the bullion

165
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,625
and help crack this
investigation, it's him.

166
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,833
Yes, sir.

167
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,166
Hey, Nas, it's Chloe Koen here.

168
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,416
I have a business proposition

169
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,374
that I think
you'll be interested in.

170
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,999
Give me a call back
when you get this message.

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,625
Okay, speak soon. Kiss kiss.

172
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:13,124
To the nearest
public house, Staff.

173
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,416
Absolutely not.

174
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,041
I'm taking you home to sober up.

175
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:19,582
Well, that is not gonna happen.

176
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,332
I'm gonna...

177
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:27,124
What do you think you're doing?!

178
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,957
Anon, Staff.

179
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,166
Master Charles!
Get back here immediately!

180
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,832
Master Charles!

181
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,499
Here he is.

182
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,292
Lady Carnation, Billy Ayers.

183
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:01,875
Even more like him up close.

184
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,499
What's this all about?

185
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,832
This is the chat.

186
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,667
I'll, I'll leave youse to it.

187
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:16,874
I'm, sorry,

188
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:20,791
but do I know you?

189
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:22,792
You know of me.

190
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:30,249
King Royston.

191
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,416
As in my old man?

192
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:34,124
Heh.

193
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,832
What about him?

194
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,041
I'm afraid I'm the one

195
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:41,916
that had him done over, lad.

196
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:46,042
As in... cut to ribbons.

197
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:51,374
Well, good on you.

198
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,750
I'm sure he had it coming.

199
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,125
Billy! Wait!

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,166
So... the truck barrels down
the frog 'n toad...

201
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,582
Hits the spike strip...
Pop pop pop pop pop!

202
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:24,125
Tires shredded like
cheddar stand at ease...

203
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,624
I run up to the driver
all cock and bulls

204
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,624
when he pulls out a heater.

205
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:38,166
Sticks dos barrels
right in my boat race...

206
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,249
But I was too quick for him.

207
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,207
I smack the heater
out of his German bands,

208
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,999
swing it around at him,

209
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,542
and he pony traps
in his Alan Wickers.

210
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,957
Look it up on YouTube, mate.

211
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,832
It's all there
in full digital glory.

212
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,082
Can I get a picture with you?

213
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,166
I've never met a real life
gangster before.

214
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:07,499
Well, now you have.

215
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,999
It's all Dom Perignon

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,250
and trips to Rio
from now on, darling.

217
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,000
She's dying, you know.

218
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,167
Shame.

219
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,957
All she wants is a wee word.

220
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,666
Talk about the old times.

221
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:41,499
No, I know everything
I need to know.

222
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,582
I'll tell the boys
to stop smelting then.

223
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,166
Will I?

224
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,167
Right.

225
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,707
What do you think
she wants to talk about?

226
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,832
How should I know?

227
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,499
Gloat, probably.

228
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,707
Listen, my parents,

229
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,624
however you tell it,

230
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,541
they come out
looking like tossers.

231
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:12,124
A pair of irresponsible wankers.

232
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,999
Random shag, baby on a doorstep,

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,624
and a dead pikey, and she is
the one that offed him.

234
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:22,499
That's a shit story.

235
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,541
Want to know what I think?

236
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,916
- Here we go.
- I think it suits you.

237
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:29,624
Having a half-assed
idea of it all.

238
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,332
Yeah, and how's that then?

239
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,291
'Cause as long as you're not
tied to something solid,

240
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:37,375
Billy Ayers, you can
walk away whenever you like.

241
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,666
After you.

242
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:51,791
I love what you've done
with the place, doll.

243
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:53,499
You can move in if you like.

244
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,207
Could do
with a hard man's touch.

245
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,916
Be rude not to.

246
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:01,166
Well, well, well.

247
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:05,291
Look what the pussycat
dragged in.

248
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:08,875
God. Not you again.

249
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,374
Buckle up, Charlie.

250
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,125
You're in for a rough ride.

251
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,082
Very subtle.

252
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,499
There he is.

253
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,999
Albert, my son and heir!

254
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,957
Father.

255
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,749
You know, you're
a resourceful one, you know.

256
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,291
How'd you find us, Albert?

257
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:53,957
Call it an educated guess.

258
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,249
He's half shot up
your boy, isn't he?

259
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,332
Yeah, the apple does not fall

260
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,957
far from the tree, Hate 'Em.

261
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,749
Ain't that the truth.

262
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,167
Come here, boy. Give me a hug.

263
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,750
Come on, give me a hug.

264
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,707
I feel the strain
of 15 years of loss

265
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,249
in your embrace, boy.

266
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,582
You're half cut.

267
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,999
Well, that is incorrect,

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,457
because I am intoxicated

269
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,833
on possibility.

270
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,332
Come here.

271
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,541
Get on down here.
Come on, here, like that.

272
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:38,541
Now you, come here.

273
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,582
So what's the idea of you
busting out of prison?

274
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,624
You know Mum's worried sick.

275
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,124
Your Mum seems all right
to me, Albert.

276
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,707
In fact, she is
positively made up.

277
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,207
Yeah, well, why don't you
come back to Norman's

278
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,666
and lay low for a little bit?

279
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,166
Lay low? I think not, son.

280
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:52,666
Myself and Hate 'Em,
we've got things to do.

281
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,541
Is that not right,
my trusty steed?

282
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:58,167
Right, yeah, our calendar's
are fully booked.

283
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:04,499
- What things?
- You know.

284
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,916
Pot of gold, end of
the rainbow and all that.

285
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:11,374
You heard anything about those
chancers that boosted it?

286
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,166
Yeah.

287
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:16,916
You got your shell-like
close to the wire, right, boy?

288
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:18,624
I don't know anything.

289
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,291
Probably out of the country
and sold by now, innit?

290
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:22,374
- No!
- No, I beg to differ.

291
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,082
- No?
- Sold? No.

292
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,708
I beg to differ,
you see, because...

293
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,332
I can smell it. It's close by.

294
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,207
Very close.

295
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,667
Yeah, well, who knows?

296
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:38,332
You do know you two stand out
like a pair of big bollocks

297
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,457
on the back end
of a very small dog, don't ya?

298
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,666
Why don't you do yourself
a favor

299
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,582
and get your ass
over to Norman's

300
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,124
and give Mum one less thing
to worry about?

301
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,082
Don't make your mum's
worries your own, boy.

302
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,666
You'll never grow up.

303
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:52,457
Oi, Albert...
Albert, where you going?

304
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,083
Stay, stay! We'll have a shandy.

305
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,708
Flying Squad. Shit.

306
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,291
Mum, I found him.

307
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:29,832
Where is he? Is he okay?

308
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,582
He's fine. He's at the Spieler.

309
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,374
There's two... two unmarked
outside casing the joint.

310
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,791
Looks like Heavy Mob.

311
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:36,312
We've gotta get him
out of there now.

312
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,957
- I hope you told him off...
- I did!

313
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,874
Get a load of these two.

314
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,499
I'd go with the one on the left.

315
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,499
She'd eat you alive, mate.

316
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,666
If I ever catch him
snorting bugle

317
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,332
off that bird's tits again,

318
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,499
I'd chop it off and put it

319
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,583
in the mince, I shall.

320
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,207
Dad, we gotta get you
out of here now.

321
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,666
There's plainclothes outside.
You sure, son?

322
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:23,124
Yes, I'm sure. Come on.

323
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,125
I've got a van running
in the back alley.

324
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,042
Wait for me, wait for me!
Hey, wait for... Oof!

325
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,207
You two look
a little suspicious.

326
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,832
Lurking around
like a couple of pedos.

327
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,332
What you up to then?

328
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,666
I'll tell you what
they're up to, Shell.

329
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:47,707
They're waiting for us,
aren't you, boys?

330
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,832
No, Dad, hold up.
Slow down, slow down.

331
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,625
Slow down, slow down.

332
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:56,249
Hey, hang on, oi!

333
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,708
- No, no!
- No chance.

334
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:02,792
Move.

335
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,166
Vic, I think I've been stung.

336
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,832
Me too.

337
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,207
They've dirty, filthy
blow-piped us, Hate 'Em!

338
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,041
They've done me again, Vic!

339
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:23,666
- Hey!
- Dad, get in the van.

340
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:26,999
Unh!

341
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,416
Eddie?

342
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,499
Albert?

343
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,332
Sorry.

344
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,957
Unh!

345
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,916
He's touching me,
he's touching me!

346
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,917
Hate 'Em?

347
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:50,000
Albert? Wait for me!

348
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,917
Vic! Vic! Vic!

349
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,999
You are so naughty!

350
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,250
Jonsey, Jonesy! Isn't that...

351
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,874
Hate 'Em All Henry.

352
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,166
Get off! Move, move!

353
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:10,541
Vic!

354
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:12,583
Wait for me.

355
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,958
Too rough, mate!

356
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,333
- Shit!
- Get back in the car.

357
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,542
Fuck!

358
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,457
So... this is what it's come to?

359
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,999
Shot and tied up
by my own family.

360
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,499
What do you expect?

361
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,624
It's the only way we could
get you to listen.

362
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,041
You listen to me, Albert.

363
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,457
You unite right now,
or so help me God,

364
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,749
I will tear you another asshole!

365
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,124
For God's sake, shut up, Victor!

366
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:00,582
Just shut up!

367
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,707
Leave me alone with
your father, please, Albert.

368
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:03,916
No, I'm staying here with you.

369
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:06,541
I need to talk
to your dad alone.

370
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,750
Go on.

371
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,292
Let's hear it, Lily.
I'm all ears.

372
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:28,457
All I've ever wanted...

373
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,332
is to have you back home.

374
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,666
Don't you understand?

375
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,124
So untie me.

376
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,124
Let me show you
what I can do for my family.

377
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,499
You're bugger-all use to us
in prison, Vic.

378
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,666
So I've been bugger-all
use for 15 years.

379
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:45,999
- The penny drops.
- I have paid my price.

380
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,332
It is time to collect.

381
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,957
And what about the price
me and Albert have paid?

382
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,249
What about all those years

383
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,041
that boy never had a father?

384
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,999
And I never had a husband?

385
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,082
I'm very sorry about that, Lily.

386
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,082
If you untie me,

387
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:05,499
I promise you I will
make it up to both of you.

388
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,666
What we are owed

389
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:12,125
cannot be weighed in gold, Vic.

390
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:19,332
Do not leave me
tied up in here, Lily Hill!

391
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,499
You will stay in that chair

392
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,582
until you grow a brain

393
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,207
or a conscience, Victor Hill.

394
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,082
I'd be happy with either.

395
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,083
Lily.

396
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:34,542
Lily!

397
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,667
Lily!

398
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,375
All right, then.

399
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:55,666
Let's hear it.

400
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,333
Expect you know
your mummy was a singer.

401
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,541
Romeo and Juliet
it ain't, but...

402
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,541
it has a certain class.

403
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:21,041
Yeah, well, even a deadbeat
has his moments.

404
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,041
Yes, you probably thought
she was a drunken slut

405
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:27,499
and he was there
to nick the tour bus?

406
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,332
Well, I may have started
rumors to that effect.

407
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:34,957
Well, that doesn't
change anything, does it?

408
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,292
He had his warnings.
He knew the stakes.

409
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:42,125
Marriage promise was struck
when we were still kiddies.

410
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:48,166
Ask you this, love.

411
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:51,457
Why do you think he risked
it all that morning?

412
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,624
You must have wondered.

413
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:57,291
All he had to do was leave
your ma alone for five minutes,

414
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:59,875
meet me at the altar,
he'd still be alive.

415
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,458
It's okay. That's it, baby.

416
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,874
Drunk, stubborn.

417
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:16,207
How should I know?

418
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,499
He sent me this.

419
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,500
The night before...

420
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:28,000
Poetic little bugger,
weren't he?

421
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:33,541
"I'm sorry, but feck it,

422
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:35,375
I love her."

423
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:41,124
That doesn't help.

424
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:44,624
And it doesn't change anything.

425
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:48,375
Put down roots. Take a stand.

426
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:54,083
Take it serious.

427
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:03,332
All that fairytale bullshit.

428
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,791
It's what got him killed.

429
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:07,667
Aah!

430
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:20,707
No. No, you daft twat!

431
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:23,082
What killed him
was sending a sorry note

432
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,583
to someone who couldn't read!

433
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,833
You bastard!

434
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,666
Well, I stayed here anywhere.

435
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,832
And I tell you, Billy,
it's an easy life.

436
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:08,332
Satellite telly,
BaByliss foot spa,

437
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,707
and access to every
dreamboat in camp.

438
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:14,374
But sometimes, Billy,
sometimes...

439
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:17,166
The hardest thing
is the better thing, you know?

440
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:19,667
I learned that the same time
as me ABCs.

441
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,833
He made the right choice.

442
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:31,124
I'm sorry
I buggered it up for him,

443
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,500
and I wanted to say so before...

444
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:38,583
I don't...

445
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,749
Isn't this lovely, Charlie?

446
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,832
Getting to know each other
a little better

447
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,499
over a bit of raw fish.

448
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,707
What the hell
do you want from me,

449
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:34,666
you fuckin' lunatic?

450
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,041
You know exactly what I want.

451
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:37,666
But I'm done asking,

452
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:40,041
so I'll just let you
volunteer the information

453
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:41,332
in your own good time.

454
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,999
You'll get nothing from me.

455
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,874
Do you think
your friend Albert Hill

456
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,957
would take the same
punishment for you?

457
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,832
I do. Twice as much.

458
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:53,957
Well, where is he, Charlie?

459
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,791
You're the one tied up
on the floor

460
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:57,999
like a beaten dog.

461
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,374
You're the one about to get

462
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:00,791
each and every one of your teeth

463
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:04,082
kicked down your noble throat.

464
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:08,624
And your best pal,
maybe your only pal,

465
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:13,500
is nowhere to be seen.

466
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:16,832
You might want to consider

467
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:19,250
re-buttering your bread mate.

468
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,333
Ahem.

469
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:31,332
Fair warning, mate.

470
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,916
Things are gonna get a lot worse

471
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,416
before they get better.

472
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:38,417
God.

473
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:46,291
- We had him.
- Had?

474
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:47,832
In the past tense,

475
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:50,416
as in, "We no longer have him?"

476
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:53,291
He slipped through the net, sir.

477
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,457
Far be it from me

478
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,874
to draw attention
to the self-evident,

479
00:29:57,875 --> 00:30:00,416
but in this age
of equal opportunities,

480
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:03,832
I was so very much
looking forward

481
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:06,332
to proving the naysayers
wrong in my...

482
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:09,666
<i>recommending a woman</i>
to lead the Flying Squad.

483
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:11,499
I was the best candidate
for the job.

484
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,957
Well, that's
where we differ, Dwyer.

485
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:15,916
I think the best candidate
for the job

486
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:17,999
would be up to the task
of tracking

487
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,832
a stick up artist long past
his sell-by date

488
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,874
and his eight-foot
Neanderthal bushwhacker

489
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:25,332
without allowing them...

490
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,457
to slip through the net.

491
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,957
I can explain, sir...

492
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:31,167
One moment, please, Dwyer.

493
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,957
If you don't lock down

494
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:52,832
Vic Hill, Dwyer, I will.

495
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:56,124
And then what use
would I have for you?

496
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:58,125
On it, sir.

497
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Right.

498
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,042
Vic.

499
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:32,791
You okay?

500
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:34,708
Having a ball,
thanks for asking.

501
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:42,249
I feel for you, Vic. Truly.

502
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,332
Heh.

503
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:45,666
I can't imagine being away

504
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:48,082
from a... beautiful family
like yours

505
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,999
all those years.

506
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,832
It would've tore me apart.

507
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:56,042
Every second of every day.

508
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,333
Here.

509
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:32,333
How long have we known
each other, Norm?

510
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,999
Wow. Heh!

511
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Must gotta be pushing
30 years now.

512
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,708
We kicked in a few doors
back in the day, pal?

513
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,708
More than doors, Vic.

514
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,999
I've let you all down.

515
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,167
I know that now.

516
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:58,832
I want to make it right.

517
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:01,166
For Lily.

518
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:03,291
For Albert.

519
00:33:03,292 --> 00:33:05,332
For you, Norm.

520
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,166
For me?

521
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:09,457
Well, let's face it.

522
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:13,332
Things haven't been easy for you

523
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:15,166
these past 15 years either.

524
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:18,124
Got left out on your ass
when I got nicked.

525
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,874
I feel responsible for that.

526
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:23,291
Well...

527
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,875
Hasn't been easy.

528
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,041
Cut me loose, old pal.

529
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,166
Let me make things right.

530
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:36,167
For all of us.

531
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,666
Well, that gold is...

532
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:45,124
as much mine as it is anybody's.

533
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,957
Right, Vic?

534
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,333
More than most, Norm.

535
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,332
Be lucky, Vic.

536
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,500
Luck's for losers, Norm.

537
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,499
Listen, I... It's possible
that I've...

538
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,750
been, like...

539
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:03,874
Keeping you
at arm's length or whatever.

540
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:06,166
For...

541
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:09,999
For the wrong reasons.

542
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,374
I'm so used to just...

543
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:16,375
Move-about-able-ness?

544
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:22,208
Move-about-able-ness.

545
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,666
Then... maybe we should just

546
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:31,832
stay put for a bit.

547
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:34,207
See if it fits.

548
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:36,874
Yeah.

549
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:38,708
Yeah.

550
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:06,875
Your owner's a bugger,
you know that?

551
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:12,832
Scooter...

552
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:14,666
I think it's possible
I may have cocked up

553
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:17,333
in an unprecedented sort of way.

554
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:25,124
Remind me to apologize
to Chloe and Albert.

555
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,374
If I ever get out of here alive.

556
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,999
Okay, Nas, that's great.

557
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,291
Let me know
your travel arrangements

558
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:34,957
and we'll work out
all the details.

559
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,249
Okay.

560
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,749
Bye.

561
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,749
Yes!

562
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,499
What are you all excited about?

563
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,666
Nas Stone is coming
to London tomorrow morning.

564
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:47,832
Is he really?

565
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,374
And we're happy about this why?

566
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,457
He wants the rest
of the gold, Albert.

567
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,374
Like all of the rest of it.

568
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:55,541
I have to be competitive
with the price.

569
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:58,499
15% discount
for the bulk purchase.

570
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,999
I hope that's okay, but he says
he'll take all of it.

571
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,999
Yeah, no, that's more than okay.

572
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,667
That is brilliant!

573
00:37:11,292 --> 00:37:12,582
Albert!

574
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:15,124
Yeah? What's up?

575
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,499
- He's gone.
- What do you mean he's gone?

576
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,042
Your dad, he's gone!

577
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,208
Oof! Unh!

578
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,749
- Shit!
- Unh.

579
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,333
You ever think to use
the zebra crossing?

580
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,708
It might be beneficial
to your health, mate.

581
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:54,957
Vi?

582
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:57,957
Bob?

583
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,749
I'll rip your head off!

584
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,166
Put the brakes on, Vic.

585
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:04,207
You wouldn't want to assault
an officer of the law

586
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:06,374
on top of everything else
you're up against at the minute.

587
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,249
You ain't the law, Bob.
You never were.

588
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,917
Whether I am or ain't,
it suited you fine once.

589
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,541
15 years I've wondered.

590
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:21,249
Why? Why'd you do it, Bob?

591
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,707
The gold.

592
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:26,791
Decent cut earmarked for you.

593
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:30,541
Why did you rip me off?!

594
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:34,166
I could pretend it was
the promise of a bigger cut.

595
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:36,624
I could pretend the badge
was still worth a toss

596
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:40,124
back then, but you know
the truth, Vic?

597
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:43,666
They took me out for a pint.

598
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,082
Flying Squad detectives
and brass.

599
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:49,291
They acted like I was crew.

600
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:50,624
That simple.

601
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,291
To to you lot,
I was only ever...

602
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:56,582
Convenient grass.

603
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:59,666
Why you hassling my family?

604
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,916
Tracking Albert, arresting Lily.

605
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:03,582
What do you want?

606
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:05,499
You know what.

607
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,041
Same thing as you.

608
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:10,332
Nah.

609
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,291
It's more than the gold
isn't it, Bob?

610
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:15,957
Fact is, it ain't really
the gold you want at all, is it?

611
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:18,999
Then you tell me, Vic.
What is it?

612
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,666
What is it I want?

613
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:25,832
Bragging rights.

614
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:26,833
Pride.

615
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:31,166
Suck some of that poison
inside of you.

616
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:34,249
Show 'em all
who the smart one is, right?

617
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,416
I see you.

618
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,916
I put you...

619
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:41,582
I put you onto the best scores
of your career.

620
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:46,332
I made Vic Hill. Me!

621
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,832
All you had to do

622
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:51,707
was just show a little bit
of appreciation.

623
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,791
Aww!

624
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,457
The cold bloody fish
who just wanted a cuddle.

625
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,291
You sold us to the Sweeney

626
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:00,291
just because
they pretended to like you.

627
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,832
First chance they got,

628
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,166
they heaved you
out of the way and all.

629
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,457
Do you know why,
do you know why?

630
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:06,457
Enlighten me, Vic.

631
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:08,124
Because you're a sinister
bollock, a fuck-up merchant

632
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:09,916
that no one wants at the party.

633
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:11,832
It's because
you cannot be trusted

634
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:15,208
with big boys toys.

635
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,582
You're right.

636
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:26,874
I am a very sad man.

637
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:32,041
I'm a very lonely man.

638
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:34,041
Not like you.

639
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:37,832
Surrounded by
your loving family.

640
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,582
Where are they again?

641
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:41,791
Some people
just don't appreciate

642
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:42,999
what they've already got.

643
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,291
They're too blind to see

644
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:47,125
what's right under their noses.

645
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:52,082
You know something.

646
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,916
You've got a lead
on the metal, haven't ya?

647
00:40:54,917 --> 00:40:56,416
You've only gotta ask, Vic.

648
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:57,957
I'll clue you in.
Level playing field.

649
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,832
May the best man win
and all that.

650
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:03,417
All you've gotta do
is say "please".

651
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,874
Like, you said, pride.

652
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,332
You rob me of mine.
I'll have yours instead.

653
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,832
The gold is mine!

654
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:12,499
And I will not have some slimy
little two-Bob shit nick it

655
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,167
because nobody ever hugged him!

656
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:19,957
You don't know, do ya?

657
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:21,791
You have no clue.

658
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:24,250
Know what?

659
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:33,292
Bang.

660
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:42,624
You hugged your boy lately, Vic?

661
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,875
You think he trusts you
with the big-boy toys?

662
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:02,333
Albert?
